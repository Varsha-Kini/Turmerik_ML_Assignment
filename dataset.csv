Hi everyone!

I work at [Massachusetts General Hospital](https://www.massgeneral.org/) (Boston) in our body dysmorphic disorder clinic. We deliver cognitive behavioral therapy for people with BDD and treat many people each year. Over the years, we have seen a need for flexible and accessible therapy that people can use from the convenience of their own home. 

We have therefore created a smartphone-based treatment, *Perspectives*, that delivers digital cognitive behavioral therapy for BDD. Over the course of a 12-week program, the app helps users gain skills to target BDD symptoms through CBT exercises on their phone. Users are also paired with a coach who offers support throughout the program and answers any questions or concerns they may have. 

We are conducting an ongoing research study to test how well *Perspectives* works in terms of improving BDD symptoms and related mental health symptoms.

After an initial pilot trial, we are now opening the study up to more people to further test the app’s potential benefits. We hope that developing and testing this CBT for BDD app will give many more people access to treatment.

We are looking for people with BDD in the United States who might benefit from this smartphone-based therapy, to use the app in our clinical trial, at no cost to them.

If you are interested in learning more, you can find the details on our website: [https://perspectives.health/](https://perspectives.health/)

Alternatively, you can always email me directly at [bdd@partners.org](mailto:bdd@partners.org).

I hope it can be of some help!!",8,hi everyone work massachusetts general hospital boston body dysmorphic disorder clinic deliver cognitive behavioral therapy people bdd treat many people year year seen need flexible accessible therapy people use convenience home therefore created smartphone based treatment perspective delivers digital cognitive behavioral therapy bdd course week program app help user gain skill target bdd symptom cbt exercise phone user also paired coach offer support throughout program answer question concern may conducting ongoing research study test well perspective work term improving bdd symptom related mental health symptom initial pilot trial opening study people test app potential benefit hope developing testing cbt bdd app give many people access treatment looking people bdd united state might benefit smartphone based therapy use app clinical trial cost interested learning find detail website alternatively always email directly bdd org mailto bdd org hope help,joy
"I’m 32, and I’ve struggled with an eating disorder for almost three quarters of my life. My mother was a former fashion model and she wanted me to be a figure skater, so there was immense pressure on me from a very young age to be extremely thin. My mother constantly insisting I was fat and ugly led to my diagnosis of body dysmorphia later on. Over the years, I’ve recovered and relapsed about a thousand times.

I was doing okay until I got pregnant. I gained a ton of weight (most of which turned out to be severe edema and I had to be abruptly induced before my heart crapped out, fun times), and my husband turned cold. By cold, I mean “went almost four years without giving me a single compliment.” The best he could muster was “you look okay/fine.” 

I chose him because he was a genuinely kind man who treated me with respect and shared my values...but somewhere along the way, after we were cohabiting, married, had a kid...he stopped. I think it’s because I didn’t live up to his expectations, though I tried my absolute hardest to. I tried so hard to be a good wife, to make him happy. But I failed.

He had cheated in the past, three years prior to my pregnancy. He told me it was my fault because I wasn’t attractive enough. The affair partner looked somewhat similar to me, but actually pretty...and barely nineteen years old.

Of course later he said he didn’t mean it and was just lashing out in anger over having been caught, but he said it many times in a perfectly calm tone, even in front of his dad and sister, so I’m not buying it.) 

So when I was pregnant, I just assumed he was cheating and that I deserved it for being even more repulsive than usual.

It didn’t take long for me to lose the pregnancy weight. I was teetering on the edge of a serious eating disorder relapse, but managed to maintain a (lower-end of) healthy weight. Having been pregnant, I don’t look anywhere as good as I used to; diet and exercise can only fix so much. But nobody can probably tell when I have clothes on.

Regardless, I got walloped in the face with the worst body dysmorphia I had ever experienced. I was literally afraid to go outside. Taking my child to the playground was a terrifying experience and I would have to fight not to cry or panic if another parent tried to talk to me, because I was sure they would try to take my child away because I was obviously too ugly to be their mother and must therefore be a kidnapper. My child and I look very dissimilar and I’m occasionally mistaken for a nanny, so that doesn’t help. Anyway, it was REALLY distressing.

I knew I needed help, but we don’t have the funds for therapy. We live in the USA and our insurance is garbage. No mental health services covered whatsoever. And after having a child, paying out-of-pocket is just not in the budget.

Luckily, I found a clinical trial for a new type of teletherapy, meant to treat OCD and related disorders (including BDD). I was accepted into the study. My participation was to last nine months, from last November to this July. My husband discouraged me from doing it, but I insisted it was necessary for my wellbeing. The same time I started the trial, he started another affair.

To cut a very long story short, I was aware of the affair by late January and he continued to lie to my face and gaslight me until two weeks ago. I begged him to tell me the truth while I still had access to a therapist. He, of course, waited until a few weeks after therapy had ended (and after I dropped video proof of his affair into his lap) to come clean. Every time I felt like I was making progress in therapy, he would drop some sort of bomb on me and it would set me way back. Asking for an open relationship with the affair partner (who he refused to admit he was already cheating with), and blaming me for his “need” to sleep with other women. Telling me how much he resented me. Telling me about how he felt a need to “take me down a peg.” Stuff like that.

The affair partner has a very different body type than I do. She’s quite voluptuous, and I’m rather...flat. He didn’t say it this time, but I kept hearing, in my head, all his remarks blaming me for his first affair because I am ugly. So of course, the body dysmorphia kicked back in and got worse than before doing the therapy trial. Of course, now the eating disorder is back with a vengeance too. I’m totally open about it with my husband. He doesn’t explicitly approve of it, but he doesn’t discourage it either. He’ll say, “you’re fine, you don’t need to lose weight” in a halfhearted way when I complain of being fat, but I don’t think he actually minds. I’m not thin enough for it to be worrisome yet, so he’ll let me keep getting slightly less ugly until I approach that threshold.

Last night I snooped on his phone. He had spent quite a while looking through a subreddit for porn of severely underweight women (I’m just barely underweight, and definitely MUCH visibly larger than these women). The ones he clicked on were all barely-legal teens, all dangerously underweight. He proceeded to stalk through a teenage girl’s NSFW profile for ages yesterday evening...a girl who has a BMI of 15 (she posts her stats on her pictures). He knows I’ve been periodically checking his phone since the affair came out...did he WANT me to see this?

He stalks the profiles of random severely underweight teenagers on Facebook, too. He comes across a post of a local mom selling her daughter’s old junior prom dress with photos of the sixteen-year-old underweight daughter wearing it, then stalks the daughter’s profile. Shit like that. He just wants to look at someone beautiful, I think, instead of being stuck looking at me.

I was also able to access his iMessage backups. He’s been flirting extremely heavily with a coworker, as recently as yesterday. I don’t know if they’ve slept together yet, but I know him well enough to know he’s trying. I looked her up on their company website—she looks IDENTICAL to the first woman he cheated with. An attractive, nineteen-year-old version of me. An upgrade of the same model. I could look like a middle-aged version of her if I lose a ton more weight.

I haven’t confronted him about it yet, but he won’t admit to cheating (or even flirting) with her even after I show him the messages. So what’s the point?

I don’t think it really matters whether I stay or leave...it’s my own mental health I’m concerned with now. Even if I left today (and I couldn’t if I wanted to, logistically—our area is getting its butt brutally kicked by the pandemic and I’m currently unemployed), it’s irreparably damaged and I don’t have access to the mental health treatment necessary to even begin fixing it. I’m already on antidepressants, but they haven’t fixed anything except my energy levels—helpful, but inadequate.

I don’t even know why I am writing this. None of this would be happening if I hadn’t let myself go. If I were prettier, thinner, looked younger...was anything but a massive disappointment to the man I love. So do I really have any reason to complain? I don’t know. I just feel like absolute crap and needed to scream it into the void.

"I am so sorry to hear you are going through this. For one, your husband is cheating because he is a bad person, not because of how you look. He is ruining your marriage! From how you describe it you are taking extreme measures to fit a unrealistic expectation set by your mother and continued on by your husbands terrible comments and behavior. BDD can distort reality in ways most people can't imagine, your husbands behavior is purely his doing. Your pain is acknowledged and there is no need to apologize for expressing how you feel. I know it's easier said than done but try to positively acknowledge that you carried a child. Your body is going to change and your husband should appreciate your body for what it has given him (child).

I am happy to hear you were able to receive some form of help. Your top priority in life should be your child and your mental health. It doesn't seem like your husband will ever give you the support you need and you deserve MUCH better.

"Classic Dunning-Kruger. Kids with a high school biology background at best like to think that the words 'double-blind' and 'control group' automatically make a study flawless and impervious. When you get to college you'll learn about implicit and explicit biases in the medical world and how it has systemically undermined patients who are either female, POC, poor, young, or underprivileged. You'll get to read about all the ways medical knowledge for the same conditions are set back by a few decades for women compared to men because women are not worth studying. You'll learn about how fibromyalgia wasn't even considered a real condition until the 1980s, and still not even considered a real condition by many doctors today because of the systemic dismantling of women's credibility in the medical world. 

This kind of thinking is the reason why glomular filtration rates in black people have been miscalculated and systemically causing them to die of kidney disease. It's the reason why women are far more likely to die of stroke. It's the reason why POC have far higher maternal mortality rates than their peers in the same hospital. It's the reason why research into fibromyalgia has been so lacking. It's the reason why so many people with fibro is still suffering to no end.

The reason is simple: some people cannot comprehend the idea that experiences outside their own are real and valid. It's the same reason some people will tell people with fibro 'you have it because you don't exercise enough' or 'acupuncture is fake and you're faking it when you say it helps' or 'if you have a migraine why don't you just drink water?'.

I have to admit that I am pretty clueless about that, just like you might be clueless about getting diagnosed with fibromyalgia as a man at a relatively young age.  My initial diagnosis was depression and anxiety, and I was referred to a psychologist.  Fun times.

>Are you completely oblivious to the opiod under prescription epidemic for people with chronic pain, and how it has driven many to suicide due to lack of pain medication?

I wouldn't say that I am completely oblivious.  My fibromyalgia is relatively mild, but I have been taking Tramadol for it for about a decade.  My leash has been shortened several times.  I used to get at least a 3 month supply, but now I have to go to the doctor every month for a repeat prescription and I have to see a specialist every year or so just to make sure that I still need it.  Such fun.

>You like to say acupuncture is fake in one breath and that it relieves pain in the other

Both can be true.  Sticking a needle into the skin causes sensations that the nervous system can respond to in a positive way.  Choosing specific locations to stick the needles into based on imaginary chi flows can be complete nonsense.

I actually tried acupuncture so I am speaking from experience.  My practitioner listened to my complaints about very rare symptoms, nodded and told me that my symptoms are very common and that what was causing them was a chi blockage to the liver.  After a few treatment sessions my practitioner gave me some very expensive unlabelled herbs to take.  I didn't return.

"So I'd never heard of small fiber neuropathy (SFN) until my first visit with my neurologist last month. He said that a lot of SFN patients are misdiagnosed with fibromyalgia, but I'm not sure if it's accurate to say that or that the two are similar and often comorbid. (SFN is his specialty though, so I'm not going to argue the point with him)

I never got a separate call about my biopsy results, and I told the woman on the phone that, so she double checked my records just to be sure. And yes, my results were consistent with SFN.

I don't know what this means for potential treatment options, because we agreed that I'm not the ideal candidate for this particular study, which is focusing specifically on foot and leg pain, while I experience pain all over my body. But looking back, the numbness and pins and needles did start in my feet a few years before the all-over ""my skin hurts"" pain took hold. 

If your fibro symptoms started in your feet and worked their way up, or your hands, you might want to talk to a neurologist about checking for SFN. (Warning: the test is a skin biopsy. It takes a few weeks for the wounds to heal, and mine are still pretty sore after a week and a half.)

But I have a piece of the puzzle now. And maybe I can help other people if they get tested and get a positive result. Something to show people who obnoxiously insist that fibro ""isn't real,"" to point to and say ""this is happening to me because I don't have a high enough density of small fiber nerves in my body!""

So I don't know if fibro is a handy diagnosis for people whose neuropathies haven't been specifically identified yet or if it's a completely separate condition.

"I do not have fibro, but I was diagnosed with small fiber sensory neuropathy from a biopsy. My rheumatologist had me follow with about 20 tests to exclude a long list of potential causes for my small fiber neuropathy, ranging from HIV, diabetes, mercury poisoning, and so on. He was being very thorough. Everything came back normal except a high CRP and a folate deficiency. A previous doctor had checked my B12 levels, which were just above normal. My rheumatologist gave me a folate prescription but decided based on the results that I have idiopathic SFN and recommended IVIG infusions. I was moving and figured my insurance would decline it anyways so I decided not to proceed but started my folate (and had already been taking a B12 supplement). Three months later my small fiber sensory neuropathy had cleared up a lot, and so had my erythromelalgia and fatigue. 

About 6 months later, all my neurological symptoms and fatigue had gone away. That only raised more questions-why did I have a folate deficiency as I didn't meet any of the normal boxes for a deficiency? Around January I stopped taking my B12 because I run out and my levels were fine. Two months later the neuropathy, fatigue, and erythromelalgia came back. Started up the B12 and symptoms went away. 

Another thing that had happened is that I had been diagnosed with mast cell activation syndrome and I had a lot of inflammation in my GI track (translate: really really bad IBS). I finally saw the mast cell specialist and told her about the folate deficiency. While there is no direct connection the working theory is that the constant inflammation caused by MCAS, may have made it difficult for my body to absorb enough vitamins through diet alone, which is why taking the vitamins helped so much. 

So my cure for SFN is ...cheap grocery store vitamins. Now this may not be the same for many other people but I highly recommend that you consider exploring the potential cause for SFN. It still blows my mind how much a difference it made and I'm glad my doctor did pursue the cause of the SFN, even though it didn't make any obvious sense at the time.

"Hey!
Thank you so much for sharing.
I'm a 25 year-old who has been diagnosed with small fiber neuropathy. 
I experience three types of pain in my feet:
1) constant pain but in random areas in feet. standing up still makes it way worse and quickly spreads all over the feet.
2) If i start climbing stairs/hill/mountain the pain transfers from under feet to the calves. 
3) once a week or so I, ONLY in bed, I get a 0.5-1.0 second of extreme pain in my feet. It feels like someone is pulling a needle through my feet. 

The constant pain feels like ""burning sensation"". As if I am constantly touching really hot summer burning stones ""ouch ouch ouch""..

After 4-5 visits to different doctors here in Sweden, I was finally diagnosed with SFN. 
Following tests were done:
Checking for deficiencies in vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, amino acids, and omega-3s - ALL GOOD
Did a cerebral spinal fluid test - ALL GOOD
EMG - ALL GOOD
MEG brain scan - ALL GOOD


I have been given Pregabalin (Lyrica) and I've increased the dosage about 4-5 times now, im around 525mg/day. First days of increasing is always really helpful but then the effect takes off and I'm back in normal pain. I have therefore quit the drugs.

I am desperate to find anything that could help me. I'd like to thank you all for contributing with your personal problems. It feels good to know that there are others out there struggling. 

Does anyone have any tips for what could be done? 
Doctors? 
Food habits?
Anything?

Thanks...

"The funny thing is that I didn't even mention my feet and leg symptoms when I was first describing my issues to the neurologist, but it happened to be his specialty, so when we started talking about my fibro, he asked the questions that led to him deciding to test me.

Personally, I don't *always* have burning pain at night. It wasn't until I read up on SFN that I realized I had the feet/leg numbness and tingling a few years back, but I had attributed it completely to the cold. (I work at home and my desk is against an exterior wall, so I was always freezing in the winter, even with my electric blanket.) It was then that I made my med my ""winter office,"" but I only moved back downstairs for the next summer. After the following winter, I never moved back downstairs because my fatigue got worse. But that was the first real sign of my SFN, the numbness creeping up my legs when I was cold. The fibro pain, to which I referred to as ""my skin hurts"" before I was diagnosed with fibro, came later. 

I'd already had an EMG and nerve conduction test, which came back as normal, so no large fiber involvement. I had a brain MRI which came back normal too. I honestly think this was a stroke of luck, finding a doc who specializes in SFN and recognized it in me, even though he was originally going to redirect me to one of his colleagues who specializes in neuromuscular disorders.

Statistically significant and clinically meaningful results were also seen in all key secondary endpoints related to improving sleep quality, reducing fatigue and improving overall fibromyalgia symptoms and function. RELIEF, the first positive Phase 3 trial of Tonmya in fibromyalgia, was completed in December 2020. It met its pre-specified primary endpoint of daily pain reduction compared to placebo (p=0.010) and showed activity in key secondary endpoints.” [Source](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/tonix-pharmaceuticals-reports-improvement-in-brain-fog-in-fibromyalgia-patients-treated-with-tonmya-in-resilient-/)

">>MindEar delivers CBT through chatbot along with sound therapy allowing brain to learn to tune out condition


>>Researchers have created an app, called MindEar, that provides CBT through a chatbot with other approaches such as sound therapy.

>>“What we want to do is empower people to regain control,” said Dr Fabrice Bardy, the first author of the study from the University of Auckland – who has tinnitus.

>>Writing in the journal Frontiers in Audiology and Otology, Bardy and colleagues report how 28 people completed the study, 14 of whom were asked to use the app’s virtual coach for 10 minutes a day for eight weeks. The other 14 participants were given similar instructions with four half-hour video calls with a clinical psychologist.

>>The participants completed online questionnaires before the study and after the eight-week period. The results reveal six participants given the app alone, and nine who were also given video calls, showed a clinically significant decrease in the distress caused by tinnitus, with the extent of the benefit similar for both groups. After a further eight weeks, a total of nine participants in both groups reported such improvements.

>>Brady said the team hoped to explore whether certain people benefited more than others from the additional support of a clinical psychologist, adding it could be that some experienced tinnitus alongside anxiety, stress or sleep disorders – meaning extra help was needed.

>>The team are about to launch a larger clinical trial of the app with University College London (UCL) hospital. Dr Lucy Handscomb of the UCL Ear Institute, who is involved in the trial, said in-person help for tinnitus was not easily accessible, while patients often experienced an increase in anxiety while they waited for therapy.

>>“My hope is that, by giving people access to this very carefully designed intervention early on in their journey with tinnitus, they will be prevented from ever entering some of the negative thought cycles that so often occur and be able to live well with their tinnitus from the start,” she said. “I don’t see MindEar as a replacement for tinnitus therapy in person but I think it could be a very valuable complement to it.”

>>The app is not the first of is kind. Among others is the Oto tinnitus app, which is the subject of a large clinical trial in the UK.

>>Matthew Smith, a consultant ENT surgeon at Cambridge University hospitals NHS foundation trust, who is involved in that trial, said apps may offer a valuable way to tackle tinnitus, particularly opening up treatment to many more patients. He also urged caution, noting CBT was only one aspect of tinnitus treatment.

>>“Hearing aid provision is an important part of tinnitus treatment for some people, and this presents a challenge for remote treatment,” he said. “[An] app alone is not a one-stop solution for everyone’s tinnitus but could provide valuable therapy to patients with this condition.”",5,mindear delivers cbt chatbot along sound therapy allowing brain learn tune condition researcher created app called mindear provides cbt chatbot approach sound therapy want empower people regain control said dr fabrice bardy first author study university auckland tinnitus writing journal frontier audiology otology bardy colleague report people completed study asked use app virtual coach minute day eight week participant given similar instruction four half hour video call clinical psychologist participant completed online questionnaire study eight week period result reveal six participant given app alone nine also given video call showed clinically significant decrease distress caused tinnitus extent benefit similar group eight week total nine participant group reported improvement brady said team hoped explore whether certain people benefited others additional support clinical psychologist adding could experienced tinnitus alongside anxiety stress sleep disorder meaning extra help needed team launch larger clinical trial app university college london ucl hospital dr lucy handscomb ucl ear institute involved trial said person help tinnitus easily accessible patient often experienced increase anxiety waited therapy hope giving people access carefully designed intervention early journey tinnitus prevented ever entering negative thought cycle often occur able live well tinnitus start said see mindear replacement tinnitus therapy person think could valuable complement app first kind among others oto tinnitus app subject large clinical trial uk matthew smith consultant ent surgeon cambridge university hospital nh foundation trust involved trial said apps may offer valuable way tackle tinnitus particularly opening treatment many patient also urged caution noting cbt one aspect tinnitus treatment hearing aid provision important part tinnitus treatment people present challenge remote treatment said app alone one stop solution everyone tinnitus could provide valuable therapy patient condition,joy

"I am sorry if this post is a bit incoherent. I am physically tired and emotionally out of it. But I really encourage you to investigate further into what I present.  **This medication will change fibromyalgia patients' lives.** 

>Significant improvements in pain, sleep and other symptoms associated with fibromyalgia were seen in SXB treated subjects compared with placebo. The proportion of subjects with ≥30% pain reduction was 42.0% for SXB4.5 g/night (p=0.002) and 51.4% for SXB6 g/night (p<0.001) versus 26.8% for placebo. [https://ard.bmj.com/content/71/6/93](https://ard.bmj.com/content/71/6/93) 

573 study participants\*

For those that just want some quick and dirty numbers\^\^. Mind you, I think participants could have gotten better results with more precise, slow titration. These trials were done about 10 years ago and I think we have gotten more sophisticated about titration of sodium oxybate.



>""Staud, R., Spaeth, M., & Sarzi-Puttini, P. (2020). The Case for Sodium Oxybate as a Treatment Option for Fibromyalgia. Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management, 16, 379-392. [https://doi.org/10.2147/TCRM.S245041](https://doi.org/10.2147/TCRM.S245041) 

I cannot access the link anymore, maybe someone else can. But essentially what the meta analysis called for was the FDA should reevaluate the dismissal of sodium oxybate for fibromyalgia since there is a lot of clinical data showing its efficacy against placebo. It also brought up the point that there aren't many FDA approved interventions for fibromyalgia anyway. Safety and adverse events were taken into account. There was nothing concerning to the authors. If I recall correctly, the safety profile is similar to that of sodium oxybate use for narcolepsy.

We don't fully understand the biochemistry of sodium oxybate yet. But there are things we do know pretty well. 

Sodium oxybate increases GABA in the brain which calms the nervous system down. It also dampens glutamate which lessens neuronal excitability (central sensitization). We know that sodium oxybate increases slow-wave sleep (deep sleep). It also lessens the amount of brain wave intrusions during deep sleep. It lessens sleep latency. We know that sleep cycles are disrupted in fibromyalgia patients. We also know that disrupting slow-wave sleep in study participants with no myalgia causes increase sensitivity to pain and tiredness the following day. 

Overall, we have an **abundance** of solid data supporting the efficacy of sodium oxybate for narcolepsy and fibromyalgia in the past 20-30 years. This drug is commonly prescribed for narcolepsy patients and did pass clinical trials for fibromyalgia, but FDA bureaucrats thought people were going to abuse it (which has been disproven) and sell it on the black market.  

\*\*If you want to use this medication, you specifically need to see a physician that is affiliated with one of the pharmaceutical companies that makes this drug. It is stupidly expensive if insurance doesn't cover the medication, but I have heard that Jazz Pharmaceuticals offers good patient programs.

"I read about this recently, because I sleep so badly and am always tired and falling asleep during the day and was trying to figure out if I have an actual sleep disorder like narcolepsy or if it's ""just"" fibro. When I read that one of the prime medications for treating that has also got good evidence as being effective for fibromyalgia, I was like wtf? How is it that a medication exists that actually has demonstrated positive effect for this condition but I've literally never heard anyone mention taking it? Oh, 'cause the FDA reckons we'll all sell it as a street drug instead of significantly improving our lives. And then I looked up to find out what the situation with this stuff is in Australia and found it's possibly even worse than in the US. It's hard to even get for narcolepsy as it's a controlled substance and not covered by our PBS so people needing it face the same cost issues that are not usually a problem for us Aussies with regards to medications. Basically there is zero chance of anybody agreeing to prescribe it for fibro and anyway I don't have a spare $600 to $1800 a month to buy it.

I fucking hate the paranoia around potentially addictive or a usable drugs. Patients are the ones who pay because we are denied access on the basis that some people might do the wrong thing. I know this isn't a new concept but it's the first time I've encountered it in relation to a non-pain-relief medication, and to know how few proven effective treatments there are for this condition and that ""the powers that be"" still don't think we are worth it is a huge metaphorical kick in the teeth.

It seems the situation is that SO can only be prescribed for narcolepsy and only after other treatments have been tried first, then when a doctor prescribes it they have to apply to get approval for it for each patient since it's a controlled substance.

"So from reading this comments it seems like what they were looking for was a differentiation between people with FM and people with other pain conditions like osteoarthritis, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Unfortunately, because they had no healthy individuals, there is no way to show that what they found wouldn't also be found in a healthy person. The other conditions they included in the study do have current tests available and are used generally when diagnosing FM to rule out the others. It also seems like the biomarkers they used to determine who had lupus and a couple other conditions were completely different then the biomarkers that are established and trusted. Also, if this was all to be accurate then unless there is some way that I am unaware of to change your genetic code, there would be no way to ""cure"" this since they are looking for an inherent genetic marker.

"I'm definitely am continuing to give it a shot. I think it has helped my pain, but its hard to tell at this point. Complicating factor for me is I had a delay getting my insurance renewal for botox for chronic migraine and was 6 weeks overdue. Only got the injections today. But of course constant migraines mess with your sleep, which is a major factor for me for fibro pain. I'm hoping over the next few weeks to see a difference. I'm continuing to take the p.e.a. and have also added acetyl-l-cartinine, which also has some research evidence for it. 

I am also going back to a pharmacy clinic our school of pharmacy has at our university next month. It was a 2 month waiting list. I've seen them multiple times since 2016. You see a doctor of pharmacy for a 60-90 minute consult and they look at all medications and all supplements you are taking and give you recommedations for changes. It's been a couple of years since last time. I find it helpful because my GP does not feel comfortable changing any of my meds without input from them. 

I will tell them about the pea and the new supplement. 

I would definitely encourage people to consider pea as it has a very good safety profile for side effects and interactions and 30 years of research. Obviously, you should consider consulting a medical practitioner before making changes. 

For me, between my orthopedic surgeon (osteoarthitis), neurologist, psychiatrist (gad), and general practitioner, it's hard to get a holistic view. I've also been to a pain clinic that recommended iv lidocaine injections. Had them 3 times, they were useless. Between covid and absences of the pain specialist, I haven't been able to get in since my last lidocaine treatment in feb 2022.

"I have Trochanteric bursitis (outer hip bursitis), and upon him touching my hip which was tender, and asking me questions, he said it was bursitis. 


Bursitis flares with too much activity which aggravates the inflamed bursa. It’s usually warm to the touch, swells a bit, and causes limited motion (usually due to pain). If a bad flare is happening, the pain can often be quite sharp, but overall it’s dull and achy. 


The primary treatment for bursitis is R.I.C.E. Since mine is in my hips, I know that too much walking or anything that puts stress on my hips should be limited, or stopped when I start to feel sore. Like a 21km hike means I should rest up after with some ice. I shouldn’t go for a long walk everyday, or do the elliptical too much. 
Strengthening exercises can help reduce pain, but can cause pain if you overdo them. 

Inflamed bursa in the spine is likely (but not always) due to a rheumatological diseases, so I agree that you should see a rheum.

"I've had fibromyalgia for 6 years. I have problems taking over the counter medications (side effects are awful) and when I started using treating my fibro with weed I stopped needing to pop pills hardly ever. 

At first, I was high all the time and that's sorta fun but not how I want to live my life plus when it starts to wear off you can cause a flare up since you get so tired (too tired is my main trigger). I've now found a nice balance where I can take 2 hits and it has a medicinal effect without me getting high. 

Sometimes I can't eat (can't swallow, loss of appetite, nauseous) and smoking weed makes that go away. Sometimes I can't sleep and smoking weed helps with that. Sometimes I get nerve pains so intense I double over and cry, but it turns the volume down on the pain so it's barely noticeable. When all my muscles are tense and in pain from fibro it vanishes as soon as I smoke. And it relaxes and anxiety or excess nervous energy I get sometimes. 

The only downsides are that if you smoke too much it'll increase your brain fog, you'll get too tired, and nobody should go around high ALL the time. All easily fixed by developing a tolerance a bit and finding the amount you need to take to treat your symptoms without being Afroman.

"I mostly have CFS, with frequent-enough aches and pains that I hang out here sometimes as well. MJ has been a major asset for me, and has helped with the physical discomfort more than anything else that I have tried.

My TL:DR; advice is (1) Be careful with edibles, the dosage is hard to predict and there are significant GI variables that affect how hard it hits you. Smoking or vaping is safer, especially for beginners. (2) Take a puff or two and wait a good five minutes before trying it again. It's not uncommon to keep getting higher for a few minutes after you stop, and it's much easier to take another puff than it is to give one back.

"Yes! I'm in California, and I have a doctor's recommendation for medical cannabis. It doesn't help every fi-bro, but for me it's been life changing. I don't smoke every day, maybe 3-4 times a week.

If you have access to good quality medical strains, you can address a lot of the specific issues. For brain fog and those days where I'm dead on my feet, a sativa dominant strain like Sour Diesel or Jack Herrer is enough to make me feel human again. I don't get high, like, ever. It simply takes the edge off so I can function. An indica dominant strain is what you want in place of a muscle relaxer or to help you sleep. If I'm having a bad flare, I'll go all out and get some concentrate. I'm incredibly lucky... A dear friend of mine wholesales to dispensaries, so I get to road test a lot of different strains. That's what I'm adamant about... Some strains are a fibromites dream... Orange Kush is the flare killer! Others I'm not so fond of... White Widdow does nothing for me. All in all, it's a crutch that I'm glad to have. If I smoke a little at night, I tend to feel quite a bit better the next day.   

If you have access, I would highly recommend giving it a try. I prefer a water pipe, but there's edibles, teas, and vaping of course. he only waste of money I've found is cannabis topical salves. Maybe it helps some people, but I've yet to find one that does much of anything.

Aside from the test, I can find no information on the vaccine treatment they want to give you. I scoured to try and find any info at all beyond that one sentence about people who test positive being invited. The whole thing makes me very suspicious. Maybe call them and ask about the treatment? 

Frankly, the whole thing seems a bit scammy. No support from actual medical community. No info about vaccine. Also, that $1000 only covers the kit. You still have to pay a clinic to draw your blood.

"Los Angeles-based biomedical firm EpicGenetics and Massachusetts General Hospital researchers are seeking approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to conduct a clinical trial next year to test the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine as a potential treatment for fibromyalgia.

"I heard about it last year, but you have to take the blood test and be deficient in all 4 or 5 markers to qualify. The blood test cost is something you personally have to cover and it's close to $1000.00. While majority of fibro people are deficient in at least a couple of these markers, many are not deficient in all of them. Also, it seems more like a side effect treatment than a fibro treatment. Especially considering other labs have discovered that the cause is most likely neuro-inflammation. That being said, neuro-inflammation could be the cause of those markers being reduced, unfortunately we really just dont know enough about the neuro-inflammation to confirm one way or the other. Personally, if I could afford the blood test, I would try to participate in the trial.

"The basis of the vaccine helping is that the BCG boosts 4 specific cytokines that are lacking in fibromyalgia patients. Those that have received the vaccine previously is irrelevant. You're not being vaccinated against fibromyalgia, you're receiving this specific vaccine (BCG) due to it boosting these specific cytokines. The cause of fibromyalgia is still unknown but they assume is due to one of the many herpes viruses... EBV, HSV, CMV, etc... 
There's an assumption that these viruses attack the immune system and modify the response of your immune system, hence the vaccine being used to ""boost""  these cytokines.

The BCG vaccine is actually being studied and numerous clinical trials underway for autoimmune disorders such as MS and diabetes type I.

Or maybe the vaccine happens to help by a completely unrelated mechanism.  The odds are very much against a random molecule reducing symptoms of fibro.

"Hi all!

So a little while back I was referred to a service by my GP, because I was about to lose a contracted job. The service was quick to respond, and is currently a clinical trial regarding the benefits of being in work when you are disabled.

Being a clinical trial, it does mean that you may be in the test group or in the baseline group. However, the potential for help is still there and this may inform treatment and services in the future. I think it’s worth a go, as I’ve been really happy with the help I’ve been receiving.

In South Yorkshire they’re called Working Win, and I have a link to the leaflet below. In the West Midlands I’m not sure what the trial name is, but if you speak to your GP they should be able to help. These guys also work closely with Citizens Advice, so you can double check which benefits you should be getting.

My experience has been great so far, and I’ve been doing this for a few months now. I see my work advisor every couple of weeks at a convenient location, and we have a list of goals to approach, bits to work on, she will help me draft job seeking letters, that sort of thing, we’ve worked on my CV, decided what jobs we want to focus on, all sorts. They’re really getting a lot of funding, to the point that if we meet in a coffee shop she gets reimbursed for my drinks (I wouldn’t let her buy them until I knew xD). They were in touch within a day of my referral. If you think you could benefit from this, you do need to consider yourself ‘disabled’, but honestly I think it’s well worth it. 

Please take a look at the leaflet, I’ll be posting this over on Chronic Pain as well. West Midlands people, still read and ask your GP! It’s always worth a try.

"Hello,

I read this article in the medical literature of an individual which had fibromyalgia for 18 years.  He was able to cured his fibro by doing FMT's (Fecal Microbiota Transfers).

[https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=75761](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=75761)

In summary, he did a stool test and found out that his gut microbiome was significantly altered from that of the general public.  He learned that FMT's can help with chronic fatigue and irritable bowel syndrome, (which he also had) and wanted to try an FMT in desperation to see if it can help with his fibromyalgia.  He screened his son's stool for any parasites, disease, or harmful bacteria, the son's stool came back as negative, meaning the stool was safe to use.

He did an online FMT protocol using his child's stool, basically blending the stool with a liquid and then doing an enema with the liquifide stool.  After the first FMT, he reported feeling significantly better, he subsequently complete 6 more fecal transplants.

From the article:

>"" The patient was interested in FMT as an experimental treatment for his mixed symptoms caused by fibromyalgia, CFS, and IBS. Given that this type of treatment is not approved for these indications, he used an online protocol for FMT screening and preparation. His son was screened for HIV, HCV, fecal parasites, and bacterial cultures. Stool was homogenized with a food processor and was self-instilled using an enema. Within 24 hours he experienced dramatic improvement of symptoms that lasted for 6 weeks. Four consecutive FMTs resulted with the same transient improvement of symptoms, lasting for approximately 6 weeks each. The improvement from the sixth course lasted for over 9 months and included additional treatment for SIBO with FODMAP and rifaximin.  
>  
>The patient reported marked improvement with total resolution of fatigue and depression, marked improvement of insomnia, oversensitivity to touch, odor, and noise. Cognitive impairment has also improved. A physical examination by a rheumatologist (JN A) was normal with no evidence of synovitis or tender fibromyalgia points, concluding that all his symptoms had improved. The patient returned to full employment and is now asymptomatic for over a year.  
>  
>A second stool microbial analysis demonstrated significant changes compared to the first analysis ([Table 1](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=75761#t1), [Table 2](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=75761#t2)). Most marked was a decrease in the proportion of the Firmicutes phylum from 99.35% to 36.17% and an increase in the Bacteriodetes phylum from 0.42% to 39.82% post-FMT. At the genus level, fecal Streptococcus proportion fell from 26.39% to 0.15% and Bifidobacterium increased from 0% to 5.23%. Additional changes included bacterial diversity index that was reduced from 3.21 to 2.55 post FMTs and a negative stool culture for Candida""


I wanted to share this here to bring awareness that this is a possible treatment for Fybromialgia.  The cause may be a gut dysbiosis/ significantly altered gut microbiome and the cure may be properly executed FMT's.  

I have not found any clinical trial regarding fybromilgia and FMT's, but seeing as this individual had such positive results it appears that this should be a line of reseach studied further by the medical community.

&#x200B;

Additionally, I'm interested in fibromyalgia because mother has been suffering with it for 30+ years, her symptoms began after giving a C-section to my sister.  About a year ago, before reading this article,  we sequenced my mothers stool.  Her stool was aproxomitly 26% streptococcus, while the general population stool is less than 1% streptocaccus.  The individual in the article also had 26% streptocaccus pre FMT and it was brought down to less than 1% after his treatments.  I have shared these findings with my mother, its not easy accepting the idea of putting some elses feaces in your body so she has not received the idea well.

"Hey, the first thing I would do is sequence your microbiome, I would do this through an integrative doctor or use a service like flore. 

 [https://www.flore.com/microbiome-collection-kit](https://www.flore.com/microbiome-collection-kit) 

Flore can confirm that you have a gut microbiome imbalance, if that's the case then and FMT can be helpful.  If your microbiome is healthy (which is unlikely), an FMT will be pointless.

I would also do a SIBO (small intestine bacteria overgrowth) test through an integrative doctor to see if you have bacterial overgrowth in your small intestine and try to get that treated, likely through antibiotics.  I think antibiotics can be a benefit because they will kill off old bacteria, and if you infuse your body with new healthy bacteria they are more like to proliferate if the old bacteria are dead or weak.  

&#x200B;

This is a good video of an individual doing an FMT on himself using a friends stool:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEMnRC22oOs&t=300s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEMnRC22oOs&t=300s)

He had ulcerative colitis for 12 years, took medicines changed his diet, spent $100k on treatment but was not cured.  A few days before having colo rector surgery, where he'd need a colostomy bag for the rest of his life, he learned about FMT's.  FMTS are not approved for ulcerative colitis and in desperation, he decided to do a DIY FMT.  He was able to find a lasting cure for his disease.  

&#x200B;

Over the following two weeks, I started getting increased pain in my joints, pain in new joints, worsening muscle pain all over, nausea, fatigue from limited activity, worsening numbness and tingling in my arms and legs. 

My pain doctor thought maybe Immune Complex Disease. My Immunologist didn't think it was that based on the labs we had. They only certain thing is that I have inflammation. She told me to see a Rheumatologist ASAP. 

Rheumatology ordered more labs. Except for inflammation, and one that didn't get done because Quest doesn't have the test, everything is still showing normal. 

Immune Complex Disease isn't fully ruled out. The timing is the only thing we have to tie it to the Evusheld tough. 

My ESR, HS-CRP, and Complement CH50 are high. Everything else so far is normal. 

On the plus side, they've ruled out leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma. 

The remaining possibilities are Immune Complex Disease, Amyloidosis, a Fibromyalgia flare, or long COVID (I've never tested positive and never had symptoms. I have been testing positive for antibodies since June or July of 2021, and confirmed that Gamunex-C has had COVID antibodies in it since at least May of 2021.)

I have pain in almost all of my joints, including fingers and toes. The muscles in my back all ache. I get out of breath just walking upstairs to my bedroom. I can't make it through a regular grocery store run without being exhausted and having significantly increased pain. 

I've learned that if I'm out of the house, for doctors appointments or errands, which are the only reasons I go anywhere now, for more than two hours, I end up taking opiates. 

I have them for rare occasions of increased pain. For several years now, I average taking 2.5mg (half a pill) less than once a week. 

This new issue, whatever it is, requires 10mg to get my pain down to a one or two out of ten. I had neck surgery in December of 2020, and didn't need 10mg a day, much less all at once. 

I'm also taking 300mg of Celebrex a day.

"Honestly, I really firmly believe that fibro is a symptom rather than a diagnosis (I would argue this for depression in my case as well), which I am OK with calling it a syndrome. I do think there is some other underlying condition but doctors haven't found it yet. I do believe all fibro related pain is all real, but I think extensive testing should be exhausted before using this label. It is definitely filled with stigma, and I think generally hurts patients because too many doctors either don't take us seriously and like to blame everything on fibro.

I think I was given the fibro bomb too soon. I don't think that I have had all testing exhausted. I was tested for basic thyroid and general blood testing cbc, basic metabolic, had an ana. I had a different doc do immunoglobulin testing but I hadn't gotten those results back yet.

Now that one rheumatologist in my health system said fibro, all other doctors just want to blame my issues on fibro rather than looking deeper or assume I am a hypochondriac looking for attention. The same shit happened before but it was all my depression's fault. I have low level depression constantly, not a constant MDD episode, so I think blaming the fatigue on depression is a scapegoat.

How do I get doctors to listen to me and forget the damn fibro/depression and keep looking?

I don't have the option to really go to other doctors, I mean I can go to different physical doctors, but I am stuck with one hospital system so they all just go back in my records, see the psych stuff and the fibro and just tell me to go back to my psychiatrist, which is frankly lazy bullshit. I really want to go to Mayo and just have a   complete reworkup, but my health insurance will not cover them except in extenuating circumstances (I'm assuming cancer and clinical trial stuff).

I'm trying to be a better advocate for myself.

"I do agree that many doctors aren't doing all the testing and just slap on the fibro diagnosis. And once you get that diagnosis its hard to find a doctor to really look into things.

My advice? Do as much research you can on online forums. Make a list of diseases that could cause your symptoms and look at other peoples diagnosis too that were misdiagnosed. 

Then look at your tests and see what hasnt been tested. I know this is a lot of work but once you have a list it will be a lot easier. When you get the list go to a new doc when they say its fibro, take out your list and ask why you havent been tested for that since fibro is a diagnosis of exclusion?

This is gonna be HARD but dont give up.",3,agree many doctor testing slap fibro diagnosis get diagnosis hard find doctor really look thing advice much research online forum make list disease could cause symptom look people diagnosis misdiagnosed look test see hasnt tested know lot work list lot easier get list go new doc say fibro take list ask havent tested since fibro diagnosis exclusion gon na hard dont give,fear
"I just had another disappointing meeting with a new PCP. Again, all she wanted to talk about was anxiety. Again, I had to spend most of our time (pretty sure we ran over) talking about why I don't want to take antidepressants and why I don't think treating the anxiety is the right place to start. Explaining that about the only situation where my anxiety gets that far out of control is talking to doctors, and the anxiety in that room wasn't normal for me at all. I really wanted to talk about hormones, my liver function test results, what tests are available for adrenal insufficiency, etc. We did get to hormones, but only at the very end. And honestly, she's better than the others - she did ask me what I wanted her to do for me at the end, and then we made some progress. I have some hope that next time will go better.

Sorry, ended up venting a bit. Basically, I started doing as much as I can myself, with over-the-counter treatments. Doctors are gatekeepers on anything I want insurance to cover, prescription-only meds, and lab tests (and I suspect there might be work arounds for those).

Sorry, wish I had something more encouraging. I might be giving up on Western medicine not because the medicine is insufficient, but because the care providers are. Which doesn't help you :-( But maybe ""it's not just you"" will give some comfort - I've done really well even taking care of myself.

I am not a doctor, but have you read about dysthymia? It's basically low-level constant depression, with occasional periods of MDD. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysthymia I'm pretty sure my husband has this (although maybe no longer diagnosable - I think he had it at diagnosable levels for 20 years or so), but we gave up on therapy quickly because he ran into almost the opposite issue - the ""men can't have depression, you must just be a lazy bum"" issue.",1,another disappointing meeting new pcp wanted talk anxiety spend time pretty sure ran talking want take antidepressant think treating anxiety right place start explaining situation anxiety get far control talking doctor anxiety room normal really wanted talk hormone liver function test result test available adrenal insufficiency etc get hormone end honestly better others ask wanted end made progress hope next time go better sorry ended venting bit basically started much counter treatment doctor gatekeeper anything want insurance cover prescription med lab test suspect might work arounds sorry wish something encouraging might giving western medicine medicine insufficient care provider help maybe give comfort done really well even taking care doctor read dysthymia basically low level constant depression occasional period mdd pretty sure husband although maybe longer diagnosable think diagnosable level year gave therapy quickly ran almost opposite issue men depression must lazy bum issue,joy
"Well the good news is that Fibro was discovered to officially be an auto immune disorder. So there's hope for diagnostic future and better treatment options moving forward. 

While we wait however long that takes, possibly years, the only way I handle doctors is not telling them. They tend to try to think more outside the box at first if you're coming to them without a blanket diagnosis they can just use to sweep everything under the rug with. If you're going to the doctor for Fibro symptoms though, just be honest. I've done that too and it has worked. Express your concerns and be direct and if a doctor still treats you like garbage, then you won't get results from them anyway.",2,well good news fibro discovered officially auto immune disorder hope diagnostic future better treatment option moving forward wait however long take possibly year way handle doctor telling tend try think outside box first coming without blanket diagnosis use sweep everything rug going doctor fibro symptom though honest done worked express concern direct doctor still treat like garbage get result anyway,joy
"Dysthymia with recurring MDD episodes is actually one of my 4 mental health dx. From my experience meds are terrible at treating dysthymia. I could honestly care less about the depression at this point. I just want to know why I am so freaking tired all the damn time despite taking ""activating"" meds. My theory is I actually have an underlying condition that is making them not work, and I don't know that fibro would answer that for me. Maybe for my pain, but not the essentially treatment resistant depression.

To me, a lot of mental health conditions can be SYMPTOMS, rather than a dx. I think the main problem with western medicine is we treat the symptoms rather than searching for a root cause and treating that. Yay let's throw meds at it!! 

Just like now, my blood pressure is suddenly in the 155/105 range (usually 110/70) and I'm just waiting for them to give me blood pressure pills and or tell me to lose weight (not that my weight is much different in the last month, but yeah been trying for years, antidepressants/antipsychotics make that pretty fucking hard).

Anyway, I am sorry you are dealing with shitty docs too. It's super frustrating having to basically do all the research and say hey, test me for this please. That's the only way I got someone to find my endo, and how I found out I have lowish IGG levels.

But doctors also hate informed patients and like to play the hypochondriac card, or if you have any MH dx, especially fun ones like BPD, they blame it on your mental illness and tell you to go see your psychiatrist.

Honestly, if your husband has dysthymia I would caution going down the med rabbit hole personally, but obligatory not a doctor. I've been at this for 10 years and still can't find a workable combo. If he would be willing (and you have access/$ therapy is hella expensive in the US anyway) maybe look into DBT, but I know most guys are super opposed to therapy.

Anyway, most depression meds are chalk full of side effects so I hear you on not wanting to try to use that to treat anxiety or your husband's depression. Just keep an eye out for him as it sounds like you do. It's easy to slip and before you know it you fell ten stories. It's good he has someone who cares and supports him.

As far as DBT goes, I cannot stand CBT. To me it feels like it is basically telling you that everything you think is wrong and you need to change (aka I'm a bad person, can't do anything right...on and on) which to me increases my feelings of shame and makes things worse. DBT pulls from CBT but also from zen Buddhism. It focuses more on being mindful of thoughts and accepting that thoughts are just thoughts and not facts. It also gives you actual skills to use (activities, what to do in crisis, etc) where my experience of CBT was summed up in catch a thought, find the distortion, and change it, rather than notice thought, acknowledge your brain is doing things that brains do, and let it pass.

I have a love/hate with DBT. I think the concepts presented work for me but putting it into practice after years of maladaptive coping is hard as balls. But love/hate (hate is probably too strong, more like frustrating as hell sometimes) is better than my pure unadulterated loathing of CBT.

My experience with CBT (never worked with a therapist, btw, and only used what I read online for inspiration for what I actually do) was that the source of the distortion was someone's partly toxic thoughts, but also was often physical - like, anemia. Or low Vitamin D. Or low blood sugar. Or, like a crying infant - something probably is wrong, but you can't always figure out what it is, and that's okay.

"Been wanting to report success with the ""Pridgen Protocol.""

I've been on the Famvir + Celebrex combo for 10 months, and it's made huge difference with my fibro pain and other symptoms. 

I don't feel 100% ""cured"" of FM. But the pain is down 80%. Fibro fog, down 70%. Still having headache/nausea, but down about 50%. 

I'm able to work 9 - 5 in an office, again. I'm a writer, so, lots of keyboard work, even though hand/wrist pain had been my most crippling symptoms, pre-Pridgen. I can sit for much longer without hip pain, though switching chairs every 20-30 minutes is still necessary. 


I've also gotten my active outdoors life back. I'm on my bike 1+ hours per day, 3 days a week. And I run 30 min / walk 15 min twice a week. I'm even doing 80 pushups (in 3 sets) 3 days a week. Elbow pain had kept me from doing pushups for 20+ years.


I'm on other meds, too, FYI. Here's what I take.

Famvir, 500 mg x 2/day.
Celebrex, 200 mg x 1/day.
Cymbalta, 60 mg x 1/day.
Mirtazapine, 30 mg x 2/day.

Note-1:  the dosages for the Famvir/Celebrex are not technically Pridgen Protocol. I don't think anyone who's not involved with the clinical trials knows what the official dose is. The dosage listed above is the first dosage we've tried. It worked. So I'm sticking with it.


Note-2:  I've tried another meds combo of similar drug classes, but it didn't work at all:  Valacyclovir + Mobic. Tried several different dosages, too. Nothing.


Note-3:  I had been on Cymbalta/Mirtazapine for 3-4 years before starting the Pridgen meds. I never saw this kind of pain reduction with those two meds alone.


Note-4:  I also take Vitamin D (5000 IU), Magnesium Malate (300 mg), and eat foods high in magnesium.

"I have been trying to find a rheumatologist to transfer care from a pain management doctor and get a new full workup since I have not done so or seen a rheumatologist since 2019. I have a complicated medical history both my primary and I suspect that fibro may not be the underlying condition. She told me to see a rheumatologist and I told her I have already called more than 5 rheumatologists, the Mayo, and Johns Hopkins and have been rejected for each one. Because they don't ""treat"" fibro. Most of them give me info for a pain management doctor for a second opinion even though I've seen two and I've run the full course with the one I have now.

So. Does anyone know of anything anywhere anyone that I can get treated for fibro/reconsider the diagnosis and get a full workup? I had an rheumatologist appointment next week and they literally called and said the doctor reviewed my records and there's nothing she can do to help me. And then gave me info for another pain doctor. If she viewed my records she'd know I've seen two and I've done every single procedure and taken every pain management doctors offer. This includes a massive list of opioids and other meds which, my primary says she's never seen prescribed for fibro. And I already know that none of those meds and pain management doctors in general are not appropriate or a good fit for treating fibro. And since none of those hard medications have worked, including IV ketamine, I just can't help but think something more is going on.

Another question: is it possible to, for example, schedule an appointment with a rheumatologist for another reason they treat besides fibro, just so they will see me? 

I can trave anywhere. I would be sad to be completely broke but I will do literally anything at this point. Including clinical trials, but I have bipolar and that excludes me for like 50% of studies lol. So fun.

"Can I tell you about my life? I only get ten minutes in my appointment, so I rarely get the opportunity to tell you about me and how Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome really affects me. I get ten minutes to tell you about my pain and if I’m having a bad day I’ll sit there crying, through desperation for relief and you might feel this desperation for just a second, however if it’s a good day I fear I have to put on the best performance of my life and speak at 100mph to try and convince you of how badly I’m struggling before you interject and tell me that I have to learn to live with this pain.

I know this and I’d find it a lot easier to accept if you had tried every licensed pain medication there is available, before making this grand sweeping statement. But you haven’t. Not even close to it.

You say this, then my ten minutes is up, you write up my notes and I’m gone from your office, and then in that moment your pain is gone, your pain that was me is gone, but my pain that I have to live with stays, it stays with me everywhere I go.

To the world my illness is invisible, my condition is mental and hidden away, nothing tangible to find in a test (nothing to see here!) My pain is invisible but I know it’s there, I feel it every second of the day and believe me when I say my family and friends know it’s there, because they see me crying and pacing and curling up into a ball, holding myself together as if somehow my body will fall apart piece by piece, if I let go.

Did you know I used to be a basketball player? Did you know that I used to be on the football team in high school? Did you know that I work(ed) 12 hour days, five nights a week to independently support myself? No. Of course you didn’t know these things, I don’t have time to tell you all this in ten minutes. Did you know I am no longer any of these things? Why? Because Fibromyalgia and CFS has taken all this away from me, in the same way it’s taken away my social life, friends, employment opportunities, happiness, figure and any zest for life that I once had.

So, why when I come to you crying because I can’t put one foot in front of the other without my hips jolting in agony, because I can’t bend my ankles and have to walk flat footed,  I dread showers because the water hitting my skin makes me wince, that reasonably warm baths burn my skin, the cold physically hurts my skin, my fingers hurt to move them, I can’t bear physical contact because my skin feels pained, my spine and back feel bruised to touch, direct sunlight is painful, my abdomen hurts and my jaws and gums throb with pain, which in turn become headaches, my knees throb with pain to the point where my legs start to shake in agony and I walk with a near constant limp, why do you deny me the pain relief that helps me? But instead brandish me an addict?

Why are you so afraid to prescribe opiates? They are addictive, yes, but it also soothes all of the above symptoms. This in itself is mortifying. I go there everyday doing the walk of shame, the pharmacists are rude and assume I’m an addict, necking pills for pleasure. In many ways yes, I am an addict, certainly dependent, most definitely dependent, I’m dependent on these pills in order to attain some semblance of a life, to be a father, a husband, a student, an employee, a participant in society. 

But with this reasoning in mind I guess you could say I’m addicted to oxygen too. I rely on Oxygen to stay alive, and if I hold my breath for a minute or two my body begins to crave it so violently, I go dizzy and panic and start to gasp until my body has consumed two lungs full of air. I’m also addicted to water, if I don’t have water for three days my body shuts down, my blood pressure drops and I begin to die, I guess I’m addicted to food, nutrients and minerals too. If I eat and drink more than is necessary to survive, I could become obese, put strain on my body, develop heart disease, develop diabetes and become very unwell. The best part is that this is slowly happening because my Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome make it almost impossible to exercise. So why does society say we are allowed to risk damage to our bodies in this way, but we aren’t allowed to risk our bodies with a couple more pills here and there to be as pain free as possible, to be able to function as best we can for ourselves and our loved ones. I can buy all the alcohol I desire, I could drink myself into a stupor, this alcohol that has the added benefit of reducing one’s sense of consequence, risk and danger, this alcohol that contributes to filling our accident and emergency departments most weekends, tying up valuable resources. 

I understand there are laws regarding medication and licensed prescribing and doctors are not allowed to break the licensing rules. I get that, I understand there are safety issues or at least I understood this for a while until I went to a pain clinic. But something that has become quite clear to me during my battle for comfort is that the fear of accountability and where the buck stops appears to massively outweigh what really helps the patient maintain a better quality of life.  Allow me to elaborate on what I mean by this.

At the pain clinic I was told that they didn’t recommend opiates because there weren’t many cases suggesting it worked for all Fibromyalgia sufferers and yet it does for some. I explained that regardless of how it affects others, opiates do in fact help me, so isn’t that what’s important here? After all we are here at this moment in time, this particular appointment to talk about how we can help me. They asked me instead to try a Lidocaine infusion, which is a heart drug?? I asked how effective is this treatment? To which I was told, there have been no real clinical trials to measure this and basically some patients said it has worked and others said it made no difference whatsoever (which is exactly what you just said about opiates but instead deemed this as too weak a result to justify prescribing them). Regardless of me pointing this contradiction out they still pushed for me to try this infusion, ‘you should give it a go’ they said. ‘Would you like us to put you forward for the Lidocaine Infusion? We can do it now but you’ll have to sign a waiver because, wait for it….It’s not licensed to treat pain.’ Right……hmmmm……..confused……so now it’s okay to prescribe something that has no real clinical evidence as being effective and OUT OF LICENSE but as long as I sign to agree to this it doesn’t matter if it all goes badly, as there’s no comeback on you and nothing I can do about it because I knew it wasn’t a licensed treatment. That seems reasonable in total double standards land. Next I was offered drugs to treat seizures. But I don’t have seizures why would I need a drug to treat seizures? ‘Because some patients say it’s helped, but some say it hasn’t (hang on, I’ve heard that before somewhere), ‘by the way these drugs could cause seizures in somebody whose never actually had one before!’ So, to summarize you are advocating trying an unlicensed heart drug and unlicensed seizure medication because it has helped some faceless, nameless people, even though I’ve just sat here and said that opiates (as in actual medicine licensed to treat pain) is what helps me but you would rather I didn’t use this because of their addictive nature? Did you not hear me when I listed my symptoms? Am I missing something here? You’re telling me that risking drug dependency is the reason you are refusing to give me my life back with a couple of extra pills but it’s okay to risk seizures and a reaction to lidocaine with medication not licensed for what you are Intending to use them for, but if I ask for pain medications... No way!

Now you’re just making me feel shame for asking for pain relief because I don’t have one of the most horrible and devastating diseases there are. Does it not matter that people with Fibromyalgia suffer from constant pain and have their lives derailed? I’ve explained how it’s changed mine. Doctors tell me all of the time that Fibromyalgia is still a bit of a mystery and that they don’t really understand it. Exactly you don’t understand it, it is thought to be related to chemical changes within the brain but again, it is thought, but you aren’t sure. So when it comes to this disease and how it effects us and what helps us, maybe consider us sufferers the experts.

Therefore, I’m asking all doctors as a Fibromyalgia and CFS sufferer, when you meet a patient with this disease, believe what we are telling you, trust our descriptions of pain, look at the person behind the symptoms, consider who and what we were before today, we often are seeking pain meds but not for the reasons you believe we are, we are also seeking empathy, to be heard and to be understood. Drop the guilty until proven innocent mentality or should I say the drug-seeking until proven diseased mentality.

"I am so sorry you have gone through this. It seems every person with Fibro has this same story. I am so glad I no longer live in the United States. It wasn't until I moved to the Netherlands have I been treated like a patient and not an addict. 

I have actually been the one to ask my pain specialist to lower my doses of opiates. I have weaned myself off of medications so I know that I can do it. 

I have a wonderful pain doctor. He listens to my needs, and if I find a new medication through research, he is always open to giving it a try. The only time he doesn't is 1) If he has had negative experiences before or 2) If they don't have the medication here.

Currently my pain doctor is out of the office on vacation, but I can't wait until he returns. I've recently had a huge shock that what was thought to be pain from my Fibro was actually due to osteonecrosis of the knee.  I had weaned myself off of the opiates because they really never help me, and I wanted to try to find ways to control some of the individual pain I have. I didn't feel all my pain was due to Fibro, even though all my doctors had insisted it was. My pain doctor though listened to me and sent me to a knee specialist hoping that he would give cortisone injections that would help with the pain in them. 

The knee specialist didn't seemed too concerned until after I had an MRI scan and found 2 large spots in both my knees where the bone was dead. When my pain doc returns from holiday I think he will be blown away. Now I know though that my severe knee pain isn't Fibro related. The knee doctor was surprised I was even able to walk, and currently the only medication I take for pain is aspirin...

I wish everyone could have the same quality of health care as I have found here. Not just treatment wise, but the respect. I have been on mega doses of opiates. No one has ever treated me as an addict, a drug seeker, or anything but a person in severe pain. The biggest difference is I think, is we don't have the addiction problems in the US. Doctor's don't look at pain patients  who are physically addicted to opiates as ""drug addicts"". Of course my body has been addicted to opiates. There is no way around that. I think the problem began in the US for many reasons, one from doctors under-prescribing... Where patients weren't given enough for sufficient pain relief making them go looking for more elsewhere... (Where doctors then weren't able to monitor dosages) Also government stepping in and controlling how much doctors could prescribe and they had to cut patients off, forcing them to look on the street finding anything to take away their pain. Even if that means illegal drugs, such as Heroin.  It is all just sad...",10,sorry gone seems every person fibro story glad longer live united state moved netherlands treated like patient addict actually one ask pain specialist lower dos opiate weaned medication know wonderful pain doctor listens need find new medication research always open giving try time negative experience medication currently pain doctor office vacation wait return recently huge shock thought pain fibro actually due osteonecrosis knee weaned opiate really never help wanted try find way control individual pain feel pain due fibro even though doctor insisted pain doctor though listened sent knee specialist hoping would give cortisone injection would help pain knee specialist seemed concerned mri scan found large spot knee bone dead pain doc return holiday think blown away know though severe knee pain fibro related knee doctor surprised even able walk currently medication take pain aspirin wish everyone could quality health care found treatment wise respect mega dos opiate one ever treated addict drug seeker anything person severe pain biggest difference think addiction problem u doctor look pain patient physically addicted opiate drug addict course body addicted opiate way around think problem began u many reason one doctor prescribing patient given enough sufficient pain relief making go looking elsewhere doctor able monitor dosage also government stepping controlling much doctor could prescribe cut patient forcing look street finding anything take away pain even mean illegal drug heroin sad,sadness

"I couldn't agree more.

I can sum up my experiences with doctors with a simple phrase: victim blaming. Sounds like you have suffered similarly. I used much the same arguments as you describe here, but to no avail. I tried for many years, exhausted every other option.

Eventually I turned to the opioid addiction maintenance program. Not because I was an addict - I wasn't, and had to fake it through various means - but because I knew opioids worked. After many years of trying to get adequate treatment, and knowing that unless I got relief within a few months, no more, that I would take my own life, I was forced to take this course out of *desperation*.

Lo and behold, they worked. But at what a cost. My freedoms are severely curtailed, and am treated like scum regularly. I will never be taken seriously for traditional pain treatment ever again (then again, I wasn't taken particularly seriously in the first place - ""too young"" 🙄 - so perhaps there's no difference here), and treatment at hospitals is similarly impacted (I don't mean at the ER; I wouldn't ever bother with it for pain. I worry about what it will mean for the ER for something else, though, should that be necessary some day).

But, I am alive, so it was worth it. I sure wouldn't be if I had continued to follow the ""advice"" (aka ""suffer more quietly"") of the doctors.

My story is far from unique.

"I'll play devil's advocate here,

Opioids are not a long term management option. Opioids simply mask the pain without stopping the root cause. More so, long term use changes the neurochemistry in your brain. You begin misinterpret pain stimuli and become hypersensitive and tolerant to dosages. Soon you'll have to take triple the dose to get 1/2 the relief while still suffering critical side effects.

Also lidocaine infusion therapy isn't a cardiac drug. It's simply a local anesthetic that is given intravenously to affect your entire body. Antiepileptics are also shown in clinical studies to treat chronic pain. Both of these may be the wrong choice for you but medically speaking they are more viable than just pumping you full of opiates.

I'll also say that doctors have seen hundreds if not thousands of patients in your exact situation. Patients with chronic back pain, neck pain, myalgias, anemias, etc who use prescribed opioids for pain but have become addicted and spiral out of control. 

The opioid epidemic kills 40k people every year. Clinically speaking, no one has ever died from pain. 

I'm not necessarily trying to argue with you, just offering you an opposing viewpoint ",10,play devil advocate opioids long term management option opioids simply mask pain without stopping root cause long term use change neurochemistry brain begin misinterpret pain stimulus become hypersensitive tolerant dosage soon take triple dose get relief still suffering critical side effect also lidocaine infusion therapy cardiac drug simply local anesthetic given intravenously affect entire body antiepileptic also shown clinical study treat chronic pain may wrong choice medically speaking viable pumping full opiate also say doctor seen hundred thousand patient exact situation patient chronic back pain neck pain myalgia anemia etc use prescribed opioids pain become addicted spiral control opioid epidemic kill k people every year clinically speaking one ever died pain necessarily trying argue offering opposing viewpoint,sadness

"I appreciate the perspective provided (: there are several therapies that are going to be much better long-term options than opiates are, with more utility, less tolerance and less risk of serious side effects (including out-of-control opiate dependence and overdose death), though opiates remain very useful in an acute or short-term setting.

I do wish that physicians took pain more seriously though. Being told to “suffer more quietly” definitely hits home hard. At the same time, I’m also aware of the absolutely devastating impact that the philosophy of “pain as the fifth vital sign that must be managed at any cost” had on the US in the second half of the 20th century, the effects of which we are still in the thick. I would love to see a middle ground, because while blindly throwing unlimited opiates at anyone with mild discomfort certainly isn’t the answer, neither is letting patients with chronic, severe or debilitating pain suffer. Chronic or debilitating pain is a significant risk factor for a variety of conditions, suicide being the most prominent. It is a symptom associated with a higher mortality rate, lower life expectancy and often sequelae of isolation, chronic stress and worsening of comorbid conditions.",7,appreciate perspective provided several therapy going much better long term option opiate utility le tolerance le risk serious side effect including control opiate dependence overdose death though opiate remain useful acute short term setting wish physician took pain seriously though told suffer quietly definitely hit home hard time also aware absolutely devastating impact philosophy pain fifth vital sign must managed cost u second half th century effect still thick would love see middle ground blindly throwing unlimited opiate anyone mild discomfort certainly answer neither letting patient chronic severe debilitating pain suffer chronic debilitating pain significant risk factor variety condition suicide prominent symptom associated higher mortality rate lower life expectancy often sequela isolation chronic stress worsening comorbid condition,joy
"Pain increases blood pressure, and cortisol....  heart issues. So it could cause death, after several years of chronic pain. 

Pain can also change the neurochemistry in your brain. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.

Fibromyalgia is a condition that causes people to feel pain in the muscles and soft tissues all over their body. People with fibromyalgia also have many places on their body that hurt a lot when they are touched. No one knows what causes fibromyalgia.

Fibromyalgia is one of a group of chronic pain disorders that affect connective tissues, including the muscles, ligaments (the tough bands of tissue that bind together the ends of bones), and tendons (which attach muscles to bones). It is a chronic condition that causes widespread muscle pain (known as ""myalgia"") and extreme tenderness in many areas of the body. Many patients also experience fatigue, sleep disturbances, headaches, and mood disturbances such as depression and anxiety. Despite ongoing research, the cause, diagnosis, and optimal treatment of fibromyalgia are not clear.

In the United States, fibromyalgia affects about 2 percent of people by age 20, which increases to approximately 8 percent of people by age 70; it is the most common cause of generalized musculoskeletal pain in women between 20 and 55 years. It is more common in women than men.

&#x200B;

**What causes fibromyalgia?**

The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown. Various physical or emotional factors (such as infection, injury, or stress) may play a role in triggering symptoms, although many patients report a lifelong history of chronic pain.

In people with fibromyalgia, the muscles and tendons are excessively irritated by various painful stimuli. This is thought to be due to a heightened perception of pain, a phenomenon called ""central sensitization."" Other conditions may also develop as a result of central sensitization, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS); chronic headaches; chronic pelvic and bladder pain; and chronic jaw and facial pain.

There is no generally agreed-upon explanation for how or why central sensitization develops in some people. The most plausible theory suggests that there is a genetic component, meaning that some people are predisposed to having a heightened sense of pain. People with a parent or sibling with fibromyalgia have a higher chance of developing it themselves. In some cases, various stressors, including infection (eg, Lyme disease or viral illness), diseases that involve joint inflammation (eg, rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus), physical or emotional trauma, or sleep disturbances appear to trigger the development of fibromyalgia.

Brain imaging studies in people with fibromyalgia and related chronic pain disorders have shown changes in brain function and connections between different parts of the brain. As research continues, the factors that lead to chronic pain in fibromyalgia will be better understood, hopefully allowing for the development of better treatments.

&#x200B;

**Does fibromyalgia cause symptoms besides muscle pain?**

The primary symptom of fibromyalgia is widespread (or ""diffuse""), chronic, and persistent pain. Although the pain is felt in muscles and soft tissues, there are no visible abnormalities in these areas. The pain may be described as a deep muscular aching, soreness, stiffness, burning, or throbbing. Patients may also feel numbness, tingling, or unusual ""crawling"" sensations in the arms and legs. Although some degree of muscle pain is always present, it varies in intensity and is aggravated by certain conditions, such as anxiety or stress, poor sleep, exertion, or exposure to cold or damp conditions. People often describe their muscle symptoms as feeling like they always have the flu.

The pain may be confined to specific areas, often the neck or shoulders, early in the course of the disease. Multiple regions are eventually involved, with most patients experiencing pain in the neck, middle and lower back, arms and legs, and chest wall. Areas called ""tender points"" can feel painful with even mild to moderate pressure. Many patients with fibromyalgia feel that their joints are swollen, although there is no visible inflammation of the joints (as would be found in forms of arthritis).

Persistent fatigue occurs in more than 90 percent of people with fibromyalgia. Most people complain of unusually light, unrefreshing, or nonrestorative sleep. Difficulties falling asleep, awakening repeatedly during the night, and feeling exhausted upon awakening are also common problems.

People with fibromyalgia may also have sleep apnea (when the person stops breathing for a few moments while sleeping) or restless legs syndrome (when there is an uncontrollable urge to move the legs). Like some painful conditions, these sleep problems might also be triggers of fibromyalgia. If you have one or both of these problems, your doctor will likely recommend a formal sleep evaluation to confirm the diagnosis

Many people with fibromyalgia also have depression and/or anxiety at the time of diagnosis, or develop one or both later in life. However, this is true of most chronic pain conditions, and fibromyalgia is not simply a physical manifestation of depression.

They can also have:

* Trouble thinking clearly
* Flu-like symptoms Headaches
* Depression and anxiety
* Stomach pain
* Too many or too few bowel movements (diarrhea or constipation)
* Pain in the bladder or the need to urinate in a hurry or often
* Problems with the jaw

&#x200B;

**Is there a test for fibromyalgia?**

No, there is no test. To diagnose it, doctors and nurses review your symptoms. If you have symptoms of fibromyalgia, your doctor should obtain a medical history and do a physical exam to rule out arthritis, other connective tissue problems, neurologic conditions, and other disorders that may be causing your symptoms.

Routine laboratory tests may be recommended to help exclude certain conditions, such as inflammatory arthritis, thyroid disease, and disorders of the muscles. Results of these tests are normal in most people with fibromyalgia.

Doctors might diagnose fibromyalgia if you have pain in many parts of your body and they cannot find another cause. This is more likely if you also have other symptoms that can happen in fibromyalgia, such as trouble sleeping, feeling very tired, and trouble thinking clearly.

&#x200B;

**How is fibromyalgia treated?**

There are medicines and strategies to help with the symptoms of fibromyalgia. But there is no 1 treatment that works for everyone. You and your health care team will need to work together to find the right mix of treatments for you. In general, treatment can include:

Medicines to relieve pain, improve sleep, or improve mood Physical therapy to learn exercises and stretches Relaxation therapyWorking with a counselor

To get the best treatment, many people need a team that includes:

* A doctor
* A physical therapist
* Someone trained in mental health (such as a social worker or counselor)

&#x200B;

**Should I take medicines?**

In addition to exercise and coping techniques to help manage symptoms, many people with fibromyalgia benefit from medication. The medications that have been most effective in relieving symptoms of fibromyalgia in clinical trials are drugs that target chemicals in the brain and spinal cord that are important in processing pain. These include some of the medications usually used to treat depression (antidepressants) and epilepsy (anticonvulsants). By contrast, medications and techniques that work to decrease symptoms of pain locally, such as antiinflammatory drugs and analgesics, are less effective.

The best medication for you will depend on your symptoms, preferences, and cost concerns, as well as which drugs are available in your area. Your doctor can talk to you about options and how to begin medication therapy. In general, medication is usually started at a low dose and then increased slowly as needed.

**Antidepressants** — There are several different classes of drugs used to treat depression (see ""Patient education: Depression treatment options for adults (Beyond the Basics)""). Some of these can be effective in treating fibromyalgia symptoms as well.

* Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) – These drugs are often used first in treating fibromyalgia. Examples include amitriptyline and nortriptyline. Cyclobenzaprine, a closely related medication, may help in treating fibromyalgia but is not effective for depression. Taking TCAs before bedtime may promote deeper sleep and may alleviate muscle pain. Lower doses are usually used in fibromyalgia than the doses needed to treat depression, but even when taken at low doses, side effects are common; they may include dry mouth, fluid retention, weight gain, constipation, or difficulty concentrating.
* Dual-reuptake inhibitors – These drugs, also called serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), can help with symptoms of fibromyalgia as well. They include duloxetine and milnacipran. The most common side effects are nausea and dizziness, but these are generally more tolerable if the dose is started at a low level and is increased very slowly.
* Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors – Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine and paroxetine may also be effective in fibromyalgia. However, they are not as effective for pain reduction as the tricyclic or dual-reuptake medications. SSRIs are not typically used as initial treatment of fibromyalgia, but doctors might try them in some situations. These are a group of antidepressant drugs that work to increase the concentration of serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is a naturally produced chemical that regulates the delivery of messages between nerve cells.

**Anticonvulsants** — Certain anticonvulsants (drugs used primarily for treating epilepsy) may help to relieve pain and improve sleep. They include pregabalin and gabapentin and are thought to relieve pain by blocking certain chemicals that increase pain transmission. The most common side effects of these drugs include feeling sedated or dizzy, gaining weight, or developing swelling in the lower legs; however, most people tolerate these medications well.

Often, more than one class of these drugs are used together. For example, a low dose of a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor would be taken in the morning and a low dose of a tricyclic antidepressant or another drug would be taken at bedtime.

**Other drugs** — You may wonder about other medications for treating your symptoms. However, evidence is limited, and it's important to talk with your doctor about your situation and what approach is most likely to help.

Fibromyalgia does not cause tissue inflammation; thus, neither nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (sample brand name: Aleve) nor glucocorticoids (steroids) are effective in relieving fibromyalgia symptoms. (See ""Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)"".)

Analgesics (pain-relieving medications) are sometimes added to fibromyalgia medications for people who need additional short-term pain relief. They include acetaminophen (sample brand name: Tylenol) and the prescription medication tramadol (sample brand name: Ultram), which may be used alone or in combination. Tramadol is an opioid, although it is weaker than other opioid drugs and less likely to result in addiction. It may cause dizziness, diarrhea, or sleep disturbances in some people.

There is **no** evidence that long-term opioids are effective in treating fibromyalgia symptoms, and these drugs come with potentially serious side effects as well as a risk of addiction. Some people with fibromyalgia have reported that cannabis products, particularly cannabidiol (CBD), are helpful; however, this has not been studied sufficiently to confirm benefit and safety of these compounds. The Arthritis Foundation has urged the US Food and Drug Association (FDA) to expedite the study and regulation of cannabis for the treatment of fibromyalgia.

&#x200B;

**What are non-medication options?**

**Exercise** — Regular exercise, such as walking, swimming, or biking, is helpful in reducing muscle pain and improving muscle strength and fitness in fibromyalgia. If you are beginning an exercise program for the first time, it's best to start slowly and gradually increase your level of activity. Over time, exercise typically improves fibromyalgia symptoms. Muscle strengthening programs also appear to improve pain, decrease the number of tender points, and improve muscle strength.

It can also help to work with a physical therapist to develop an appropriate, individualized exercise program that will be of most benefit to you. Eventually, a good goal is to exercise for at least 30 minutes three times weekly. A separate topic review discusses exercise and arthritis; some of these approaches may also help people with fibromyalgia. (See ""Patient education: Arthritis and exercise (Beyond the Basics)"".)

**Relaxation therapies** — In some cases, participating in stress-reduction programs, learning relaxation techniques, or participating in hypnotherapy (hypnosis), biofeedback, or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may help to relieve certain symptoms. Of these approaches, the most is known about CBT.

CBT is based on the concept that people's perceptions of themselves and of their surroundings affect their emotions and behavior. The goal of CBT is to change the way you think about pain and to deal with illness more positively. CBT has been especially effective when combined with patient education and information, ie, learning about your disease and how to manage it.

Mind-body stress reduction (MBSR) programs have been effective in fibromyalgia. MBSR may be individual or as part of a group and may involve discussion, meditation, and other techniques, such as hypnosis and biofeedback. During biofeedback, patients use information about typically unconscious bodily functions, such as muscle tension or blood pressure, to help gain conscious control over such functions.

**Tai chi and yoga** — Some people with fibromyalgia benefit from a traditional Chinese exercise called tai chi (which combines mind-body practice with gentle, flowing movement exercises) or yoga.

**Acupuncture** — Acupuncture involves inserting hair-thin, metal needles into the skin at specific points on the body. It causes little to no pain. In some cases, a mild electric current is applied to the needle, termed electroacupuncture. Most studies have found acupuncture to be helpful but there has been little difference found between traditional and ""sham"" acupuncture.

**Multidisciplinary therapy** — Fibromyalgia typically responds best to an integrated management program, combining medications, exercise, and cognitive approaches. This works best if a team of health care professionals is involved.

&#x200B;

**Is there a link between fibromyalgia and COVID-19?**

Although many chronic medical illnesses may have been exacerbated during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, patients with pre-existing fibromyalgia may be particularly vulnerable. Stress and social isolation adversely impact mood, including depression, and anxiety, as well as sleep disturbance, which are common symptoms in fibromyalgia.

There is also evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated new cases of fibromyalgia. For example, chronic, unexplained widespread pain is common for months after the initial COVID-19 infection, a common symptom in what has been termed long COVID syndrome. Such patients often meet the clinical criteria for fibromyalgia.

"Have to say after exercising for 6 days a week for over a year now, it hasn't improved my pain at all. I'm not alone in this, I know and regularly speak to friends with fibro who agree that exercise usually makes them feel worse. I very slowly paced myself and increased how much I do. It's moderate intensity and varied exercise, and it's hell. Do my calves look good? Kinda, they're more toned now. Do they feel good? Hell to the no. The only benefit I seemingly get from exercise is that it sometimes makes me feel less depressed

"I was originally diagnosed with a motor neuron disorder about 10 years ago. I enrolled in a study at the NIH in 2015 that didn't provide any treatment - it was just a genotype/phenotype study (they wanted to collect information about the different ways different types of disorders expressed themselves). I found the study on their website, and it was relatively easy to go through the application process. While I was there, I was told I likely *didn't* have a motor neuron disorder, and I have recently received confirmation that's likely correct. So, I got undiagnosed. After I was there, I managed to sweet talk my way into getting another visit set up with the head of the movement disorder department. He was not able to provide an answer, either. 

This past February, I applied to the NIH's Undiagnosed Program that @genetictypo referenced above. My experience applying was similar to what they described - it took months for me to get all my records collected, and then I received an initial denial. However, in my decision letter, it was mentioned that if I completed several more tests and still didn't have an answer, I could ask for my application to be reconsidered. It was going to involve an extreme amount of coordinating (I live on a tiny island with little medical care, so I had to take a 15 hour flight to my where my family is, since I also needed their help) and cost me a few thousand dollars (though they gave me a grant that helped with $1k of the expenses), and I finally received word of acceptance in October. 

I will be going for my visit in January, but it sounds like my experience will be very different than the one Genetic Typo had. I will be going to one of their satellite sites, and they are only planning to do a couple of tests and have me see the neurologist and the geneticist, but no one else. I'm still excited to be able to do it, but am a little disappointed that my experience will be so different than what they advertise.",1,originally diagnosed motor neuron disorder year ago enrolled study nih provide treatment genotype phenotype study wanted collect information different way different type disorder expressed found study website relatively easy go application process told likely motor neuron disorder recently received confirmation likely correct got undiagnosed managed sweet talk way getting another visit set head movement disorder department able provide answer either past february applied nih undiagnosed program referenced experience applying similar described took month get record collected received initial denial however decision letter mentioned completed several test still answer could ask application reconsidered going involve extreme amount coordinating live tiny island little medical care take hour flight family since also needed help cost thousand dollar though gave grant helped k expense finally received word acceptance october going visit january sound like experience different one genetic typo going one satellite site planning couple test see neurologist geneticist one else still excited able little disappointed experience different advertise,joy

"They did not come up with a unifying diagnosis, but many cases the NIH take on through this program do not come up with a diagnosis immediately, but there's a real possibility they never come up with a diagnosis. The reason I went into their program is that my physicians were looking for input for either a better course of immunosuppression or a recommendation on moving forward with a bone marrow transplant. I received neither of those so far. While there I received an extensive work-up that answered some of the curious questions I've had through dealing with this disease which was a good and validating experience, but not much has really changed as a result of my participation other than my tissues and many samples were collected for research.

One of the greatest aspects that I did take away from the experience is knowing that I received a 2nd opinion from the highest authority on cases like mine, knowing that even they don't have a good explanation as to what is happening in my body. There is also the added benefit that as they continue to evaluate other cases, they will likely move closer to answering the unknowns about my case.

This particular undiagnosed disease program does not seek to actively treat cases most of the time, but they do offer input to your physicians with access to running tests that other facilities won't have access to for assessing the rare and undiagnosed. They might possibly recommend clinical to look into, but that was not the case for me as my care team already has a good handle that had the same input as the NIH. For me it was mostly contributing for research and I remain answerless, but it's a good and validating experience.  


To apply to this particular program you need a referral letter from a physician on your team explaining your case and why you should be seen. From others I have talked to applying to the program, there seems to be a large range of tests that they expect you to have already underwent before taking on your case to rule out a diagnosis that a hospital system should be capable of making is my understanding. Sometimes they can be interested in your case, and request for you to have additional testing done before taking your case on. One of the other added benefits of this network is that if you do apply it doesn't necessarily send you to the Bethesda site, it's within the ""Undiagnosed Disease Network"" which can be a different facility interested in researching your case.",1,come unifying diagnosis many case nih take program come diagnosis immediately real possibility never come diagnosis reason went program physician looking input either better course immunosuppression recommendation moving forward bone marrow transplant received neither far received extensive work answered curious question dealing disease good validating experience much really changed result participation tissue many sample collected research one greatest aspect take away experience knowing received nd opinion highest authority case like mine knowing even good explanation happening body also added benefit continue evaluate case likely move closer answering unknown case particular undiagnosed disease program seek actively treat case time offer input physician access running test facility access assessing rare undiagnosed might possibly recommend clinical look case care team already good handle input nih mostly contributing research remain answerless good validating experience apply particular program need referral letter physician team explaining case seen others talked applying program seems large range test expect already underwent taking case rule diagnosis hospital system capable making understanding sometimes interested case request additional testing done taking case one added benefit network apply necessarily send bethesda site within undiagnosed disease network different facility interested researching case,joy

"No medical care. Doctors who don't know don't care are the 99%. The vast majority of physicians are unable to handle any degree of complexity. And all rare disease is in most cases is complexity. 

Genetics still has a looooong way to go as a medical specialty. First there aren't anywhere near enough geneticists. Second their protocols and decision trees are too conservative and delay diagnosis. Took me 4 years of begging to get referred to genetics. Then they blinked and decided to quit on in me. Now in like year 6 Im finally being referred to an undiagnosed disease clinic. Should have happened in year one. 

Watch the first episode of Diagnosis on Netflix. Nine years in the poor girl had to fly to freaking Italy to get competent doctors. She's going  bankrupt from the 'do nothing can't think their way out of a paper bag' care she's had in the US.  Italy did in 2 months what the US couldn't do in 9 years. But of course Italy only knew about her because she was featured in the New York times column that tries to help patients who are undiagnosed. So you have to get international level attention like you're Taylor  Swift in order to find a physician who will know what to do with you  That's how bad it is. 

There needs to be a generic diagnostic algorithm for when to suspect/pursue rare disease and it needs to be added to every reference book. Go look at the clinical reference books drs use. They feature the most common 500-1000 diseases. There are 7000+ rare diseases. How does anyone get diagnosed when rare disease is never acknowledged? They don't. 

Rare Disease needs visibility and a structured approach that doesn't rely on anyone knowing all 7000+ rare diseases. There need to be hallmarks Drs can look for.  One I've suggested is a simple benchmark  I call the Zebra Metric. You can see more on it here: https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZPRWT1Df4/",5,medical care doctor know care vast majority physician unable handle degree complexity rare disease case complexity genetics still looooong way go medical specialty first anywhere near enough geneticist second protocol decision tree conservative delay diagnosis took year begging get referred genetics blinked decided quit like year im finally referred undiagnosed disease clinic happened year one watch first episode diagnosis netflix nine year poor girl fly freaking italy get competent doctor going bankrupt nothing think way paper bag care u italy month u year course italy knew featured new york time column try help patient undiagnosed get international level attention like taylor swift order find physician know bad need generic diagnostic algorithm suspect pursue rare disease need added every reference book go look clinical reference book drs use feature common disease rare disease anyone get diagnosed rare disease never acknowledged rare disease need visibility structured approach rely anyone knowing rare disease need hallmark drs look one suggested simple benchmark call zebra metric see,joy

"I have a rare giant lipoma that has infiltrated two of the muscles in the back of my neck. It is not encapsulated so it's very difficult for the surgeons to remove it completely so it keeps coming back. It required two surgeons to remove it last time, and I had two drains. They also had to remove large sections of the muscles they infiltrated. Most people think that a lipoma is just a minor, cosmetic issue, including doctors, so it's very hard to explain that this lipoma could affect the muscles and nerves in my head, neck, shoulder, and arm. It doesn't hurt exactly but that side does get sore and tired more often and easily than the other side. I haven't encountered anyone else in person or online who's experienced the same thing or even anything similar. I actually had a doctor straight up tell me that I didn't have a lipoma. This was after I had two surgeries and two biopsies that confirmed that it was a lipoma. He was convinced that I must be mistaken, and wanted to order a bunch of imaging to prove me wrong. I sent him the MRI, the surgical notes, and the results of the biopsy but I never got to get an apology because my insurance changed and I never went back to him. It's made me fearful of asking for help because I'm afraid I won't be believed, and I don't have anyone to talk to who can understand what I'm going through. It makes me feel absolutely alone. 

Also, the surgery has damaged the nerves in the skin in the upper part of my back. Light touches feel like almost nothing and more firm touches, like massages, are deeply uncomfortable.

"Talking to doctors is the worst. They are typically very type A and don’t like not being the expert in the room. Even suggesting something to them, after my endless research on it and living in my body every single second of my entire life, needs to be done in a way that makes them think that the thing was their idea or you bruise their fragile ego and they won’t help you.

Watching the gradual shift in their attitude towards you from wanting to help at first, then after each “within normal limits” test result and every new symptom they can’t explain they just check out and seem frustrated and annoyed by your very existence. It’s heartbreaking and we do it over and over again with each new doctor or specialist. 

Speaking of each new doctor or specialist, having to explain all the tests, treatments, symptoms, medications, medical history to a new doctor is exhausting. They typically don’t have the time or patience to really look at the full picture of the person they are talking to. They only want to discuss 1-2 symptoms/issues , be able to throw a prescription drug at it, and then move along to the next person in just a few minutes. I have been through countless primary care physicians trying to find one that is willing and able to actually help me feel better, or at least listen to me and believe what I’m telling them about my body, and maybe even look at the test results and specialist notes that they receive. 

I think that all doctors need extensive trainings in being compassionate, and how to have the difficult conversations. They don’t really want to talk about prognosis at all, and as far as the end of life talks go they’d rather avoid it at all costs, up to and including offering treatment options they know will likely not benefit the patient in any way but might lessen their quality and quantity of life. There’s always a “something else we can try”, like we don’t all know that 10 out of 10 people will die from something at some point.  As a Death Doula, I know how difficult these conversations are, but they’re so important to have. Too many people die not knowing that they ARE dying no matter what fancy new drug or medical technology we throw at them.",1,talking doctor worst typically type like expert room even suggesting something endless research living body every single second entire life need done way make think thing idea bruise fragile ego help watching gradual shift attitude towards wanting help first within normal limit test result every new symptom explain check seem frustrated annoyed existence heartbreaking new doctor specialist speaking new doctor specialist explain test treatment symptom medication medical history new doctor exhausting typically time patience really look full picture person talking want discus symptom issue able throw prescription drug move along next person minute countless primary care physician trying find one willing able actually help feel better least listen believe telling body maybe even look test result specialist note receive think doctor need extensive training compassionate difficult conversation really want talk prognosis far end life talk go rather avoid cost including offering treatment option know likely benefit patient way might lessen quality quantity life always something else try like know people die something point death doula know difficult conversation important many people die knowing dying matter fancy new drug medical technology throw,love

"Just keep aware of the fact that the first part is a phase 1b trial, which means it isn’t testing to see if the treatment is effective. It’s really just testing to see if the treatment is safe and tolerable. There is no placebo group in that part. There are 3 groups, each receiving a different level of dosage, and it’s not blinded, so you’ll know which group you’re in.

The 2nd part is phase 2, randomized and double-blind, and it does include a placebo group. You won’t know which group you’re in, and neither will the people running the trial. The main goal of that phase is to determine which of the 3 dosage levels has the best response.

"Yes! So I was clinically diagnosed by symptoms, then by a “stand test” as they didn’t want to put me through the tilt table at the time because I was so fragile. My symptoms were: heart rate out of control, usually 90-100 at rest, then skyrocketed to 150-180 upon standing, combined with low blood pressure (going as low as 75/45) horrible temperature regulation, extreme dizziness and balance issues, horrible brain fog, etc etc. My cardiologist did the “stand test” in office just with a pulse oximeter to check how many beats per minute my heart rate raised when going from sitting to standing. He saw the results and was like, “you don’t need the tilt table, I’m not going to do that to you. You have POTS.” Dysatonomia is just a broader term for a messed up autonomic system since mine went beyond just the heart rate issues.",2,yes clinically diagnosed symptom stand test want put tilt table time fragile symptom heart rate control usually rest skyrocketed upon standing combined low blood pressure going low horrible temperature regulation extreme dizziness balance issue horrible brain fog etc etc cardiologist stand test office pulse oximeter check many beat per minute heart rate raised going sitting standing saw result like need tilt table going pot dysatonomia broader term messed autonomic system since mine went beyond heart rate issue,fear

"> narco-sleepy is like an intense sleepiness that feels like you’re drugged

Okay, I've had that since I was a teenager at least... never knew there was a name for it.  But for what it's worth I've been diagnosed with severe sleep apnea so that might be related for me.

For what it's worth the sleep studies down now start with home tests.  It's kind of like blood work level of accuracy for Celiac, though.  Only in lab is 100% definitive.  But if that's what's keeping you from getting tested, don't let it, the home test is much much better than nothing.  It's worth it if you have even 1 symptoms (snoring, or daytime sleepiness, etc).",1,narco sleepy like intense sleepiness feel like drugged okay since teenager least never knew name worth diagnosed severe sleep apnea might related worth sleep study start home test kind like blood work level accuracy celiac though lab definitive keeping getting tested let home test much much better nothing worth even symptom snoring daytime sleepiness etc,joy

"Hey guys! A lot has happened since my last post announcing my acceptance to the clinical trial. After more bloodwork and urine testing i was finally cleared, and recieved my injection on September 26th. It was confirmed that i was the first person to clear the pre-screening and was the first human with celiac disease to potentially recieve the medication. The team kept me under observation for 2-hours for safety purposes, but aside from some facial flushing, nothing interesting really happened. The day of the injection, and the follwoing day were entirely uneventful. On the third day though i began experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms similar to being glutened, but without the normal brainfog that i typically develop. For about 2 and a half weeks i had watery diarrhea to the point of mild dehydration that i treated with electrolyte drinks. Two days before i was to start the gluten challenge portion of the study the gastro symptoms completely resolved. I did have a sharp increase in my liver level enzymes, but this was temporary, and they have since returned to normal range.   


On October 9th i started my gluten challenge. It consists of consuming a single cooking per day that contains 3 grams of gluten. My bodily reaction to the gluten has been pretty remarkable. Aside from some mild gas, slight bloating, and occasional mild morning heartburn i have been fairly uneffected. I did a few loose stools from time to time, but they did not seem to corrolate with the consumption of the cookie.  


All in all the results i have experienced so far have been very promising and i look forward to seeing if my symptoms continue to disappear!

"Prior to the drug trial, I was very careful about cc, and to be honest, probably over cautious.  However I did still get glutened every once in a while and it sucked.  Prior to the study I was on a good streak of not having any issues for a couple of months.

They did not require a gluten challenge, I remained on a gluten free diet during the study, however, I did consume some things that I wasn't able to before with no symptoms.  For example, Reese's pb cups make me ill despite saying gluten free, but I could have those, and I was able to eat Cheerios with no issues.

I did get majorly glutened towards the end, I went to a salad place and didn't realize they cut my chicken on the same board and with the same knife they cut sandwiches.  However, I recovered much faster than I did before and my symptoms were not nearly as intense.",68,prior drug trial careful cc honest probably cautious however still get glutened every sucked prior study good streak issue couple month require gluten challenge remained gluten free diet study however consume thing able symptom example reese pb cup make ill despite saying gluten free could able eat cheerio issue get majorly glutened towards end went salad place realize cut chicken board knife cut sandwich however recovered much faster symptom nearly intense,fear

"So here's how it works:

In celiac patients, Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is an inflammatory protein that is produced in the small intestine during the presence of gluten.  In a normal person, IL-15 is synthesized following infection of a virus.  IL-15 is a major factor in the activation and proliferation of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL).  These IEL are responsible for both enterocytes apoptosis and flattening of the villi, the main histopathologic characteristic in Celiac.

The study drug is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the function of IL-15 and blocks IL-15-induced T cell proliferation.  So basically, it stops (or at least reduces) your body's attack response to gluten.",11,work celiac patient interleukin il inflammatory protein produced small intestine presence gluten normal person il synthesized following infection virus il major factor activation proliferation intraepithelial lymphocyte iel iel responsible enterocytes apoptosis flattening villus main histopathologic characteristic celiac study drug monoclonal antibody inhibits function il block il induced cell proliferation basically stop least reduces body attack response gluten,anger

"Are you still experiencing celiac disease symptoms despite your best efforts to follow a gluten-free diet?

The PROACTIVE Celiac Study is a phase 2 clinical trial testing the safety and effects of the investigational medication PRV-015. In combination with a gluten-free diet, PRV-015 aims to reduce symptoms and intestinal inflammation caused by accidental gluten exposure. You will not be asked to ingest gluten for this study.

PRV-015 has been previously tested in about 250 people in six completed research studies. These studies show that PRV-015 has been well tolerated, and in celiac patients it may reduce inflammation in the intestine and improve the symptoms of celiac disease in those who continue to experience symptoms despite following a gluten-free diet.

Requirements:• 18-70 years old• Biopsy-confirmed celiac disease• On a gluten-free diet forat least the last 12 months• Still experiencing celiac disease symptoms

Study Site Locations:• United States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii)• Canada

"Pending a DNA blood test to confirm that I have the HLA-DQ2.5+ gene, I'm now a patient in the clinical trial!  I'm so excited about this.  It is time for a treatment beyond the gluten free diet.

I've already had my first appointment of 43+ potential study visits.  The first visit consisted of:

\-Lots of paperwork and medical background information.

\-A medical exam.

\-A urine test for pregnancy.

\-A first round of blood work.

\-A gluten trial.  I had to drink a mixture of water and vital wheat gluten (tasted bread-y; not bad, but I would have prefer ed a science donut).  Then I waited to get sick.  And boy did I.  I'm super glad I've never been tempted to ""cheat"" because that was not fun.  I have been glutened before on accident, but I've never gotten that sick so hopefully this means I've never actually eaten a significant amount of gluten.  This was to establish a baseline so it can be compared to future gluten trials after taking the vaccine (or placebo).

\-While being sick, I took hourly surveys via an electronic device I've been issued about how I felt and my symptoms and also had three additional blood samples taken.  This was an 8-hour visit.

&#x200B;

Going forward:

\-Assuming I test positive for the HLA-DQ2.5+ gene (about 90% chance of this), I'll be confirmed for the study.  If I have one copy of the gene (from one parent), then I'll also be given a endoscopy before the vaccine starts.  If I have two copies (from both parents) then they won't do the endoscopy.  Also of interest:  If I have one copy of the gene, I have a 50% chance of getting the Nexvax2 vaccine and a 50% chance of getting the placebo.  If I have two copies: I have a 2/3 chance of getting Nexvax2.

\-43 visits+ (a few of these will be phone calls instead of actual office visits).  I will have to inject myself with the Nexvax2/placebo (obviously this is a double-blind study so I won't know which it will be).  The first phase is the screening period, second is the updosing phase (taking increasing amounts of Nexvax/placebo), then a maintenance phase, then a observational phase (a total of about 38 weeks).

\-There will be three additional ""gluten challenges"" during the maintenance phase; 1 or 2 of these will be gluten and 1 or 2 gluten free (blind so I won't know which is which).

&#x200B;

There will be a total of 146 celiac patients in this study which will be done in 35 centers across the US and 15 centers in Australia and New Zealand.  The goal of this study is to restore tolerance to gluten, so basically a cure if it works as they hope.  It's unknown what will happen at the end of the study so at this point I don't know if they will tell me if I even got the actual vaccine.

&#x200B;

I do get paid $75 US for each visit (which honestly, I couldn't be paid enough to do this to myself if I was only doing it for the money).  I'm not particularly motivated by the possibility of eating gluten myself, but highly motivated by the potential to play a small part in curing this disease.  I have a child and other relatives that I would be devastated to see develop celiac disease.  To be honest, it's just such a life-alerting diagnoses and it is something I have to think about constantly.  The worst part for me is feeling like a burden to my family and friends.  I'm lucky enough to be in a financial and mental place where I can adhere to a gluten free diet, but I know not everyone is as lucky as I am.

"Noting that I'm a complete layman, but: Nexvax2 is modeled on similar treatments for allergies.  The vaccine contains gluten protein and is supposed to be injected in gradually increasing dosed (up-dosing). The researchers hope that this will result in desensitizing patients' immune system and stop the T-cells from responding to gluten.  This would allow us to eat gluten AND (the biggie!) negate the health problems associated with celiac disease since the immune system wouldn't be malfunctioning in response to gluten.

For the purposes of the study, I'll be injecting myself into the skin of my stomach 11 times during the up-dosing phase (if getting the vaccine it'll be in increasing amounts each time, the last dose being 900x as much as the first).  Then 21 injections for the maintenance phase.  

The study I'm in is phase II of clinical trials (assessing if the drug does what they hope it will do).  If everything goes well it would go through a third phase of clinical trials before it can go to market so there is still a lot of work that needs to be done.

"A new treatment for celiac disease that targets the liver’s ability to clear harmful substances from the blood has shown promising results in an early phase of clinical trials, according to results presented today at Digestive Disease Week (DDW).

The drug, KAN-101, is focused on restoring normal immune tolerance of gluten by targeting specific receptors on the liver, setting off a cascade of events that re-teach the immune system not to respond to gluten. Unlike broad immunosuppressants, KAN-101 targets only the part of the immune system that drives celiac disease. It is being developed by Anokion, a clinical stage bio-tech company focused on improving the treatment and outcomes of autoimmune disease.

KAN-101 is designed to deliver proteins in an immune tolerance pathway in the liver, leveraging the natural process routinely performed in the liver. One of the liver’s functions is to clear dying cells without causing inflammation.

Results of phase 1 of the study, called the ACeD (Assessment of KAN-101 in Celiac Disease), show that KAN-101 induced T-cell tolerance of gliadin, the harmful component of gluten, in study participants after they were given a gluten challenge.

KAN-101 also controlled the broader immune response to the gluten challenge, preventing gluten-induced Interlukin-2 (IL-2) response at higher doses and blunting CD8 T-cell responses, said Joseph Murray, MD, of the Mayo Clinic and lead investigator in the ACeD trial. Murray presented the early results at DDW. DDW is an annual conference for physicians, researchers and academics in the fields of gastroenterology, hepatology, endoscopy and gastrointestinal surgery.

“Celiac disease is a chronic autoimmune disorder in which gliadin-specific T cells drive an inappropriate immune response to gluten peptides that can result in severe, life-altering symptoms and long-term gut damage,” Murray said. “By inducing immune tolerance of these cells in patients, KAN-101 has the potential to offer a durable, disease-modifying treatment for celiac disease

After that, it will become available publicly and there will be post-market studies to continue to ensure that the drug is safe and effective.

&#x200B;

Quick update:

&#x200B;

\-I did test positive for one copy of the HLA-DQ2.5 gene so I qualified continue with the study.

\-I did the endoscopy (it's an optional sub-study).  I got to speak with a study doctor before the lights went out (so take this with a grain of salt), but I remember him saying that he expects the final treatment to be in the form of a monthly allergy shot.  He also discussed the reasoning for a subdermal injection.  He said they didn't know why it was better than ingesting gluten, but it just seems to work that way.  I don't get to see the results of the endoscopy but afterwards the doctor did say that my intestine looked good and it visually appeared like I had been following a gluten free diet.  (Cool!  I wonder what it looked like under a microscope?)

\-So, done with the screening period and I'm now in the updosing phase.  I'm going in twice a week to get injections of the Nexvax or placebo.  I have noticed no real side-effects from the injections other than a short cramping where the liquid is injected.  I also once noticed a large amount of fatigue after one of the injections, but that's a hard one to pinpoint for a cause.

\-I spoke to a study doctor for a short time on a visit and he said two interesting things: 1) Those on the medicine they've worked with so far have seen a significant reduction in symptoms. 2) The updosing is necessary because if I took the final dosage first, I would experience the same symptoms as eating gluten directly.

\-I still do a nightly survey asking about my symptoms for the day (scale of 1-10) and I rate abdominal pain, bloating, tiredness, loose stools, nausea and a couple of others I'm forgetting at the moment.  Edit: just did tonight's survey and the forgotten questions are: abdominal cramping, diarrhea, gas, and headache. It also asks about the number of bowel movements I've had in the past 24 hours and to rate it's appearance on the Bristol Stool Chart.

\-If anyone happens to be interested in joining the study (US, Australia, and New Zealand), the information is \[here\]([https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT03644069?term=NCT03644069&rank=1&show\_locs=Y#locn](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT03644069?term=NCT03644069&rank=1&show_locs=Y#locn)). It looks like most locations are currently recruiting.  You do have to have blood test and a biopsy showing damage as well as noticable reaction to ingesting gluten.  I've had a quite positive experience so far.  I find it very empowering to help the science in my small way.  In case you're wondering, there is pretty much zero chance of being able to eat gluten at the end of the trial, but with any luck Nexvax will make it to market and I'll eat a celebratory donut with everyone else.  ;)

Good question.  I inquired initially in early November and my study site said they were half done with their recruiting as of last week so its not filling super quickly.  If you plan on being done within a few months time it might be worthwhile to email the site contact and give them your timeline.  FYI--They are really concerned about pregnancy while on a study medication (and recommend that you use two forms of birth control if not surgically sterile) so if you plan to pregnant in the future you'd want to talk to them about possible complications with that.  I personally didn't check into it because my husband had a vasectomy and we're sure we're done having kids.,4,good question inquired initially early november study site said half done recruiting last week filling super quickly plan done within month time might worthwhile email site contact give timeline fyi really concerned pregnancy study medication recommend use two form birth control surgically sterile plan pregnant future want talk possible complication personally check husband vasectomy sure done kid,joy

"I haven't gotten to the self-injection phase since the updosing phase injections are done by a nurse, but I'll do self-injections during the maintenance phase.  There are 11 injections during the updosing phase and there will be 21 self-injections during the maintenance phase.  I understand that they will be giving me an autoinjector to use for the self-injections.  The injections are in my stomach (alternating sides each time).  I'm not a particularly squeamish person so this doesn't bother me.  If needles bother you though, there is additionally lots of blood draws for testing purposes.

-about 5 quick calls 

Updosing Period:
-1st injection (at site) followed by 2 hour observation
-2-11th injections (at site) followed by 30 minute observation 
-It is possible additional injections could be needed at this point if you have significantly bad reactions so they can increase the dosage at a slower rate.
-Also one masked food challenge visit in this period (8 hours). 1 or 2 of these challenges are gluten and 1 or 2 are non-gluten.

-Maintenance Period:
-21 self-injections at home and they call to follow up
- 2 masked food challenges in this period (8 hours at the study site)

Observational Phase:
-One visit to the study site

"So, I just finished my Nexvax2 trial three weeks ago in time for the news that the study has been discontinued.  Of course I'm sad about the results, but I'm still happy I participated and I hope that they've gathered plenty of information that will assist in future attempts. 

So, a quick recap of my experiences:

\-The first food challenge (prior to the drug injections) was horrific.  I felt like death and vomited copiously.  

\-The first post-injection challenge turned out to be gluten free.  I was completely fine.

\-The second post-injection challenge was gluten.  Vomited three times but I felt operable the next day (took me a good week after the first one).

\-The third challenge was gluten.  Only vomited once and felt well enough to eat a Mexican lunch later that day.  I assumed I got the study drug and it had some, but not a complete effect.

So, what happened?  Was my feeling better a complete placebo effect?  Did I get the study drug and it had a partial effect (but perhaps not enough of one for them to pursue or perhaps in was a statistical anomaly?) Did my body get more ""used to"" gluten over repeated exposures?  Not exactly sure how this works, but I didn't have vomiting issues before I was diagnosed (and I certainly don't plan on experimenting with it now!) 

So no croissants on my horizon, but I would totally participate in another celiac study and I hope to see more efforts at a drug solution in the future.

"I think there's a variety of things going on (and it actually brings me back to something that I was reading about the study protocol that made me think there's a fundamental misunderstanding here that might have negatively affected the study).

First off, it is important to recognize that the celiac response, and particularly the symptoms, just isn't a 100% predictable thing. It isn't like we can give you x amount of gluten and expect a reaction that lasts 2 days, y amount to last 3 days.

There a multiple reasons for this. One is that the symptoms you are experience are not directly related to the reaction, they are an indirect result. The celiac reaction is an autoimmune reaction, which causes inflammation and damage to the lining of the intestine. This then causes a variety of changes in the gut (some enzymes not being produced, changes in the gut environment which causes changes in gut flora), and THAT causes the symptoms. Also, the symptoms can vary widely depending on what you eat after exposure (and in a lot of cases, our actual reaction to consuming gluten is really the reaction of a gut that isn't functioning properly to the meals we eat after the exposure).

So as an example, an exposure causes damage to the villi, which then causes a lack of the enzyme necessary to break down lactose (lactase). If you have some milk in the next meal (meals) after that exposure, you will probably experience symptoms because at that time you are essentially lactose intolerant. If you simply didn't consume milk, you might not have those symptoms (though you'd probably have others from whatever else you ate instead).

Another thing to consider is that the damage caused by the reaction is progressive, and it takes a significant amount of time to heal. So your gut can be in different stages of healing/damage depending on the frequency of exposures.

Also, it seems entirely reasonable that the gut flora would 'stabilize' to the conditions of the gut after a period of time. I think this could explain the common report that reactions are 'stronger' or that people become more sensitive after being on the GF diet for a while. Before going GF, the gut flora had probably stabilized for that (damaged gut) environment, after going GF for a while, the gut flora stabilize to the (good) environment, and an exposure throws that balance way off; there's all sorts of activity going on, which causes dramatic symptoms.

This is where I wonder about the protocol of the trial; I thought I read that they were doing challenges with different amounts of gluten (or 'placebo' instead of gluten). If they are then comparing that to reported symptoms to gauge the effectiveness of the treatment (as though they expect that the treatment would protect against so many mg of gluten, or make the body react as though the exposure were to a smaller amount of gluten), I think that approach is fundamentally flawed.",42,think variety thing going actually brings back something reading study protocol made think fundamental misunderstanding might negatively affected study first important recognize celiac response particularly symptom predictable thing like give x amount gluten expect reaction last day amount last day multiple reason one symptom experience directly related reaction indirect result celiac reaction autoimmune reaction cause inflammation damage lining intestine cause variety change gut enzyme produced change gut environment cause change gut flora cause symptom also symptom vary widely depending eat exposure lot case actual reaction consuming gluten really reaction gut functioning properly meal eat exposure example exposure cause damage villus cause lack enzyme necessary break lactose lactase milk next meal meal exposure probably experience symptom time essentially lactose intolerant simply consume milk might symptom though probably others whatever else ate instead another thing consider damage caused reaction progressive take significant amount time heal gut different stage healing damage depending frequency exposure also seems entirely reasonable gut flora would stabilize condition gut period time think could explain common report reaction stronger people become sensitive gf diet going gf gut flora probably stabilized damaged gut environment going gf gut flora stabilize good environment exposure throw balance way sort activity going cause dramatic symptom wonder protocol trial thought read challenge different amount gluten placebo instead gluten comparing reported symptom gauge effectiveness treatment though expect treatment would protect many mg gluten make body react though exposure smaller amount gluten think approach fundamentally flawed,anger

"What I'm thinking right now is that maybe you haven't fully adapted to your GF diet (even though it's been a few years already, as I've read in a comment). 

I'm an occupational therapy student, and part of this job is to help people adapt to new situations in order to deal with them more easily. I'm not saying you need an occupational therapist, I'm just using my clinical reflexion to suggest that maybe you haven't found your comfort zone yet. I'm about to get diagnosed celiac (expecting a call anytime soon) so I'm no good to give advice.

But I wonder, maybe you can find some restaurants that are safe and that take celiac seriously, and then you know that these exist and can rely on them when you want to eat out !
Also, maybe your actual grocery store doesn't have lots of GF options, and you would find it easier if you found a better one (in my case, I did this and I have quite a lot of options now!). 
I talked to a nutritionist this week, and she helped me A LOT to understand what to watch and what not to watch (which relieved me a lot personally). I don't know your situation, but maybe this could help you too if you need to gain some helpful knowledge ? Maybe you don't and already know everything you need, too !
All I'm trying to say is that if it's so hard to keep up with GF life, maybe you need to take a step back and see if there are things that you should reconsider and optimize in order to make it easier.

Does that make sense ? 

I'm pretty sure you won't like reading this and I'm sorry ! I know this is so hard and I'm terribly scared right now about all the struggles that are coming at me (restaurants, others not understanding, cross contamination.....).

"I work in the biomedical industry and am familiar with the FDA approval requirements (for medical devices and implants, but similar principles for pharma). They have to prove shorter-term safety and efficacy, but they can't know for sure what the effect of taking such a pill/vaccine is for a lifetime. They can run models or make cases that the compounds they use are similar to products that are out there already (and are fine), but they can't know until people have actually taken it long-term, because the body is complicated. 

Not to rip on the FDA since I think what they do is important and difficult, but first wave consumers do tend to be guinea pigs.

If people are okay with that and want to try the new medication because they think it's worth the risk, that's fine - every person has the right to make that choice.

"True say. My comment about scoping wasn't to do with clinical testing, sorry for the misunderstanding. If they are doing frequent scopes on people in clinical tests, that's as good as it's getting. I was expressing concern with the use of blood tests to establish safety of any particular food/med/procedure as they can be less sensitive to smaller, more sporadic reactions (as evidenced by the recent Omission trials where the control experiment with straight up gluten didn't result too many positives in the celiac group). I mean, they tell people who've gone off gluten already that they need to be eating a substantial amount of gluten for months in order to ensure a positive blood.

As someone with DH, I am basically able to ""scope"" myself 24/7 with 100% visibility of all surfaces, so the chance of missing a reaction is pretty much 0 for me. This results in me seeming a lot more sensitive, but my personal opinion is that this is just an artefact of being able to have a more rigorous evaluation by virtue of my presentation. Like I say though, if they are doing rigorous, frequent scopes of celiacs with primarily intestinal symptoms, that's good evidence of short term efficacy in a clinical trial.

"Omg... the Cheerios thing. Luckily I live in Canada (our association made a negative statement about them) and I can't eat oats anyways. Definitely broke my trust that a large company like General Mills could miss the mark so badly - I'd always assumed a big company would want to be very careful due to the potential financial fallout of a mistake. Wrong.   

Haven't tried Omission because of the bad celiac reviews and general scientific sketchiness of what they're doing. I think it would be fine to sell that product as long as it is clearly communicated that it can't be called gluten-free. This seems to be a big problem in restaurants and bars where I live.

"This morning i was given the news that my bloodwork came back and i have been approved for a celiac disease clinical trial! The trial is the TEVA-CeD clinical trial which you can read about: [Here](https://celiac.org/about-the-foundation/featured-news/2023/07/join-the-tev-ced-study-for-celiac-disease/)   


The trial is a stage 1 trial which, means that it has been tested in healthy subjects and was tolerated, but had not yet been tested on humans who have celiac disease. It consists of a single injection with the intention that it will block Il-15, which is thought to be responcible for the immunoreaction that is triggered by the presence of gluten in the intestines.  


Some quick facts about the trial:  


The trial is only accepting 20 people at the moment  


Participants will have a 66% chance of recieving the actual medication, while 33% will recieve a placebo.  


Participants will be provided gluten containing cookies to eat daily as a gluten challenge, but this can be stopped if symptoms become to difficult to handle. You still need to maintain your GF diet though!  


In the healthy non-celiac participants, the drug was still detectable in the blood for up to a year. The hope is that this medication could be administired just once or twice a year!  


If anyone has any questions about the clinical trial process, or you just want to talk about my cat, Chino, please feel free to ask me below, or shoot me a DM!",51,morning given news bloodwork came back approved celiac disease clinical trial trial teva ced clinical trial read trial stage trial mean tested healthy subject tolerated yet tested human celiac disease consists single injection intention block il thought responcible immunoreaction triggered presence gluten intestine quick fact trial trial accepting people moment participant chance recieving actual medication recieve placebo participant provided gluten containing cooky eat daily gluten challenge stopped symptom become difficult handle still need maintain gf diet though healthy non celiac participant drug still detectable blood year hope medication could administired twice year anyone question clinical trial process want talk cat chino please feel free ask shoot dm,joy

"**Three potential new treatments for celiac disease have updates at DDW**

Three companies developing celiac disease drugs gave updates on their treatments recently at Digestive Disease Week (DDW). DDW is the largest international annual conference for physicians, researchers and academics in the fields of gastroenterology, hepatology, endoscopy and gastrointestinal surgery.

**KAN-101**

KAN-101, being tested in clinical trials by Anokion, is designed to restore normal immune tolerance of gluten as a way of treating celiac disease. New data presented at DDW further establishes that KAN-101 induces immune tolerance to gluten, Deborah Geraghty, PhD, Anokion chief executive officer said in a press release.

“KAN-101 could be a game changer for patients, with durable treatment effects observed following administration,” she said.

The data was collected from a Phase 1 trial in which some study participants were given multiple doses of the drug. Celiac disease patients in this group received one of three dose amounts of the drug or a placebo on three separate days over the course of a week. About a week later, they were given a three-day gluten challenge.

Joseph Murray, MD, of the Mayo Clinic and lead investigator in the ACeD (Assessment of KAN-101 in Celiac Disease) trial, presented findings about the movement of KAN-101 through the body and the body’s biological response to the drug. Researchers looked at the way in which KAN-101 was absorbed, distributed, localized in tissue and excreted.

Kan-101 was cleared from circulation in the blood with about six hours across of the dose amounts. The effects of the drug were observed by researchers for up to three weeks after it was given to study participants.

KAN-101 followed by a gluten challenge led to dose-dependent reduction of gluten-induced cytokines, including Interleukin 2 (IL-2), an effect not seen in the placebo group, the study found. IL-2 is a cytokine signaling molecule in the immune system. Previous research has shown a correlation between IL-2 and symptoms in celiac disease patients, including nausea and vomiting.

Cytokines are small, secreted proteins released by cells that have a specific effect on the interactions and communications between cells. When someone has celiac disease, their immune system incorrectly reads gluten proteins as invaders. This miscue triggers T-cells, which function as the body’s disease fighting soldiers, to release cytokines and attack. This attack causes inflammation and tissue destruction.

Kan-101 targets specific receptors on the liver, setting off a cascade of events that re-teach the immune system not to respond to gluten. Unlike broad immunosuppressants, KAN-101 targets only the part of the immune system that drives celiac disease. Anokion is a clinical stage bio-tech company focused on improving the treatment and outcomes of autoimmune disease.

This is the second year Anokion has presented [results at DDW](https://www.beyondceliac.org/research-news/kan-101-results-2022/). The company launched a second clinical trial in late 2022 and plans to move into Phase 2 study this year.

 **DONQ52**

DONQ52, a drug being developed by Chugai Pharmaceuticals to treat celiac disease by blocking the immune responses that occur, was effective in blocking gluten-specific T-cells, according to early study results presented at DDW...

This isn't a lot to be fair, I wouldn't get my hopes up. They basically say 3 things:

1. The drug has a somewhat long lasting effect after clearing from the blood (3 weeks), but they don't explain what exactly the effect was and how effective it is.
2. KAN-101 may work by reducing the immune system's overreaction to gluten in patients with celiac disease, thereby potentially reducing symptoms and damage to the small intestine.

"Just curious if anyone else out there is participating in the current clinical trials for celiac drugs.  My doc has asked me to participate and while I'm very curious, I'm hesitant to try this.  

Just a little background on what I was told.  First and foremost, you must remain on a gluten free diet. This particular drug is designed to combat intestinal damage from cross-contamination only.  The drug is a powder that you mix into liquid (think Metamucil) and drink before every meal.  Bloodwork and upper GI with biopsy will be done before the drug is started and after a period of time to assess damage to the small intestine.  You are only allowed to participate if you have enough measurable damage - I'm assuming so they can actually detect improvement.

I'm glad they're working on these drugs but honestly I'm a little pissed at my doctor.  He wasn't so concerned with the possible damage last year after my diagnosis nor did he want to hear anything about my other symptoms - ""well, not everything is celiac"" and ""don't spend too much time on the internet"" - I think were his exact words.  I have a feeling he only wants to get his name attached to this study (results are being reported to the Mayo Clinic) to bolster his reputation.  Anyway, while I would love to help further science and hopefully contribute to finding a cure, I remain skeptical just because of how the medical community in general tends to treat celiac disease.  Well, that and the possible drug side effects.  None were mentioned, but they usually come with the territory.

"From Beyond Celiac:

A clinical trial testing a new celiac disease treatment has launched in the United States. Chugai Pharmaceuticals is testing their potential celiac disease treatment DONQ52 in a Phase 1 clinical trial. Phase 1 trials test the safety of a drug and how well study participants tolerate different dosages. Phase 1 clinical trials are the first step in the human [clinical trial process](https://www.beyondceliac.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Clinical-Trial-Process-Infographic-from-Beyond-Celiac.pdf) that all drug candidates must go through before they are approved by the FDA and available to patients.

When people with celiac disease ingest gluten, the immune system reacts as if the gluten is a foreign invader. DONQ52 is a monoclonal antibody that is designed to inhibit this reaction of the immune system to gluten, stopping the process that causes the damage of celiac disease. A preclinical study presented [at Digestive Disease Week in May 2023](https://www.beyondceliac.org/research-news/celiac-disease-drugs-show-progress/), showed that DONQ52 may be effective in blocking gluten-specific immune reactions. Blocking the immune system’s response is one of several current approaches in the[ drug development](https://www.beyondceliac.org/drug-development-pipeline/) [pipeline](https://www.beyondceliac.org/drug-development-pipeline/) to finding a treatment beyond the gluten-free diet. You can learn more about the immune system’s gut reaction in celiac disease [in this video](https://www.beyondceliac.org/celiac-disease/gut-reaction-video/).

This trial, called the [LILY Study](https://bit.ly/3Rxglhe), is split into two parts. Qualified participants will only complete one part of the study. In Part A, participants are given 1 dose of DONQ52 or a placebo (via injection) during a 3-night stay at a clinical site and are monitored for any potential side effects or issues. They also complete daily symptom questionnaires at home for 8 weeks, using a mobile app. For participants in Part B, all visits are outpatient, and participants are given 7 doses of DONQ52 or a placebo (via injection) at a clinical site over 10 weeks and complete daily symptom questionnaires at home on the mobile app for 16 weeks. There is an option for follow-up visits in both parts of the study to take place at the participant’s home by a mobile nurse, rather than having to travel to a clinical site. Neither part of the trial involves a gluten challenge or any intentional gluten consumption.

"It seems like there is suddenly a MASSIVE uptick in newly diagnosed people here. I am going on 2 yrs and have been watching the activity of new people join this sub — seems like more posts about being newly diagnosed than ever in the 2 years I’ve been here!

I’m not an admin, but I wonder if we can create some guides for people who are newly diagnosed to help them with the basics of coping with their diagnosis — and how we could coordinate this if others think it would be helpful.

Second, while I know there are a handful of clinical trials happening, I’m also curious if there is a correlation/causation between people who 1. Had a COVID infection and now have Celiac (and possibly other autoimmune diseases), 2. Had the COVID vaccine and now have Celiac (and possibly other autoimmune diseases) and/or 3. Had COVID and the COVID vaccine and now have Celiac (and possibly other autoimmune diseases) — and whether any research is being done on this. 

My doctor seems to think my long COVID infection “activated” my Celiac gene and because so many people seem to be joining this sub that are newly diagnosed, I wonder if that is the case for many others. Though I understand all autoimmune diseases can be caused my the body’s immune response to literally anything — stress, a bad flu infection, mono, etc.— it seems like the only common denominator in the influx of newly diagnosed people is that we all just went through a global pandemic.

Anyone else feel this way, or know if research is being done? 

And anyone else interested in a beginner’s guide to Celiac that could live on the sub? Also open to others’ ideas for things we should have here to help each other and commiserate!

"Follow Dr. Iwasaki of Yale.  She just made TIME top 100 people in the world this week.  She has been studying Long COVID.  

https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/iwasaki/projects/immunology-long-covid/

“Iwasaki proposes four possible hypotheses for the condition’s initiation and progression. They are:

Persistent viral loads or remnants hidden away in tissue and causing chronic inflammation. These viruses may not be measurable via nasopharyngeal swabs because they might be “hiding” in other internal organs, such as the gut.

Our body’s own disease-fighting B and T cells triggering an immune response — and subsequent inflammation — in a process called autoimmunity. The problem is: the stimulus that triggers autoimmunity in response to an acute infection is oftentimes occurring continuously in the body, making it difficult to pinpoint and shut down.

Dormant viruses reactivating, and/or dysbiosis of microbiome disturbing our body’s homeostasis. Humans live with trillions of bacteria and a number of viruses that are latent. When acute infection disturbs the host, these bacteria lose its composition balance and dormant viruses can become reactivated. These viruses and microbes can cause inflammation and throw off body’s homeostasis.

Macroscopic and microscopic tissue damage resulting from the initial infection. COVID-19 impacts parts of our body that we don’t commonly think about. Whether it’s our lungs or our brains or the endothelial tissue lining our blood vessels and supporting oxygen change, the virus — and the medication used to treat it — can lead to clotting or scarring in places that are difficult to reach and repair. In addition, inflammation that occurs in one tissue can trigger damage in other tissues.”",39,follow dr iwasaki yale made time top people world week studying long covid iwasaki proposes four possible hypothesis condition initiation progression persistent viral load remnant hidden away tissue causing chronic inflammation virus may measurable via nasopharyngeal swab might hiding internal organ gut body disease fighting b cell triggering immune response subsequent inflammation process called autoimmunity problem stimulus trigger autoimmunity response acute infection oftentimes occurring continuously body making difficult pinpoint shut dormant virus reactivating dysbiosis microbiome disturbing body homeostasis human live trillion bacteria number virus latent acute infection disturbs host bacteria lose composition balance dormant virus become reactivated virus microbe cause inflammation throw body homeostasis macroscopic microscopic tissue damage resulting initial infection covid impact part body commonly think whether lung brain endothelial tissue lining blood vessel supporting oxygen change virus medication used treat lead clotting scarring place difficult reach repair addition inflammation occurs one tissue trigger damage tissue,fear

I think many of these folks would benefit from some basic resources and a basic orientation to the celiac world (who prominent researchers/authorities are).

It sometimes feels like a blind leading the blind situation.

Starting in c 2021 there were studies suggesting that Covid increased your odds of developing AI diseases. T1D got a lot of focus but the odds ratio for celiac was similar in the studies I saw.

"That’s an interesting point too! More people getting routine screenings might be catching more cases of it — definitely something to consider!

I have learned SO much here and done a ton of research too. It’s all very interesting — but also a little infuriating. 

There are recorded cases of suspected Celiac that date back to the 1880s — but there are also depictions of it as early as 1-2 AD!!! So to have all the research and scientific breakthroughs that we have now for only, “eat a gluten free diet forever,” as the solution, drives me a little bonkers. I was a science major in college but switched to communications my senior year , so I didn’t pursue my science degree. But when I was first diagnosed 2 years ago, I was CONVINCED I was gonna figure out how to cure it. Everything I came up with is already being researched or in clinical trial phase — so at least I know I was on the right track! But … it feels like we should’ve had a solution by now, whether it’s a cure or even just a treatment for when we’re cross-contaminated. Hopefully something soon!

Menopause is also an interesting potential trigger because of the stress on our bodies. I also have Hashimoto’s and my rheumatologist told me there is a chance that the symptoms could, “go away” when I hit menopause, because there he says there is some evidence that the other hormonal changes would balance out my thyroid hormones. Whether that’s true, I haven’t investigated yet and I’m in my mid-30s. While I’m convinced I have some perimenopausal symptoms (which is not uncommon for people with Hashi) I’m not sure I’m all the way there yet. I’m currently unemployed, but as soon as I have insurance again I want to get my levels checked!

As far as Celiac, menopause likely couldn’t reverse any of our symptom severity since it’s an immune response to gluten and not hormonal, but it certainly could be the stressor that activates the dormant gene!

It appears that you didn’t even bother to read the journal I linked.

"Epidemiology PhD student with a masters in biostats here. The study linked in Nature (originally in Nature cardiovascular research) did not show an increased incidence because, in fact, the study design prohibits examining risk/incidence.

They say explicitly, 'Similarly, our results should not be interpreted as definitive for any causal links between COVID-19 vaccination and POTS due to the observational design of the study.'

Something for you to consider here; were you making the claim that the vaccine causes long covid based on the evidence, or did you search for evidence to back up the claim?

>There are tons of confounding factors between people who took the vaccine and mostly all of them had Covid.

The Covid part of this is a pretty big confounding factor, because we've got data from a lot of people who have had covid, and we've got data from people had covid and the vaccine, and data from people who had covid and didn't have the vaccine.

In order to make any sort of reasonable scientific conclusion, we need to look the larger datasets to see actual trends; you just can't draw these sorts of conclusions from individual case studies (simply from a statistics perspective). 

If the vaccine ""caused long covid"", that would show up in those large datasets in the form a higher percentage of the people who got covid AND had the vaccine getting long covid than the percentage of people who got covid and DID NOT get the vaccine. The info I linked to was showing the opposite to be the case.

The items you linked to don't address that at all, they are instead addressing the possibility of long term side effects of the vaccine; even if further studies were to confirm that these are actually vaccine side effects (which is something we'd learn not from case studies but from larger datasets showing a statistically significant difference), that wouldn't be ""long covid"", it would be a ""long term vaccine syndrome"" (or some other name; the articles you linked were using a couple of different proposed names).",1,free believe want minute google search something consider making claim vaccine cause long covid based evidence search evidence back claim ton confounding factor people took vaccine mostly covid covid part pretty big confounding factor got data lot people covid got data people covid vaccine data people covid vaccine order make sort reasonable scientific conclusion need look larger datasets see actual trend draw sort conclusion individual case study simply statistic perspective vaccine caused long covid would show large datasets form higher percentage people got covid vaccine getting long covid percentage people got covid get vaccine info linked showing opposite case item linked address instead addressing possibility long term side effect vaccine even study confirm actually vaccine side effect something learn case study larger datasets showing statistically significant difference long covid would long term vaccine syndrome name article linked using couple different proposed name,joy

The thing is that the numbers cited in those articles simply aren't enough to make anything clear; so many people have gotten the vaccine that statistically we should expect some of them to get sick afterwards. The question is, are there significantly more people getting sick after the vaccine that statistics would predict? Do we have a bunch of people with the same symptoms (again, numbers of the sort that we can conclude it isn't just random)?

"that's what they say for every disease.

IMHO, while cures is an important branch of disease/disability research, prevention and management research is basically ignored or very, very underfunded. I've worked in a different area of basic science research that relates to disability, and unsurprisingly (to me) people with the condition would much rather have their symptoms or other day to day issues improved rather than be cured. It's not that they don't want a cure, it's that they know some of the fixes or questions about daily management or prevention are easily answered and addressed. Some of this is rooted in ableism (assuming people who are disabled want ""normal people life"" and nothing else), and some of it is rooted in economic realities of research (industry funding from pharma and medical devices companies is your best bet for $, they are less interested in prevention or management).",0,say every disease imho cure important branch disease disability research prevention management research basically ignored underfunded worked different area basic science research relates disability unsurprisingly people condition would much rather symptom day day issue improved rather cured want cure know fix question daily management prevention easily answered addressed rooted ableism assuming people disabled want normal people life nothing else rooted economic reality research industry funding pharma medical device company best bet le interested prevention management,sadness

They did an endoscopy before and after and blood tests periodically, and they made sure I wasn't having any symptoms of nervous system infections.

I had zero reactions through the whole trial, despite eating gluten twice a day, and she mentioned that my gut actually healed during that time.

*HOWEVER*, I don't know for certain I wasn't on the placebo, or how others reacted to it, etc. So I'm not trying to sell it to anyone, but my anecdotal experience was great.

"As we kick off Celiac Awareness Month, I want to reflect on the incredible accomplishments that Beyond Celiac and our community have achieved together over the last twenty years. For Beyond Celiac, 2023 marks two decades of serving the celiac disease and gluten-free community, and we couldn’t have done it without your support.

From our humble beginnings to receiving a grant from the National Institutes of Health, we’ve grown into a national organization that has significantly contributed to the community. Now we’re the premier patient advocacy and research organization for celiac disease! Let’s talk about some of the many achievements we’ve made over the last decade.

We launched the first-ever National Celiac Awareness Campaign in the early days with Heidi Collins of CNN as our spokeswoman. We also had partnerships with Quest Diagnostics and others, contributing to an increased rate of diagnosis from just 3% in 2003 to up to 50% today. We trained 900 medical professionals and estimated that we led to 6,000 new diagnoses. We also partnered with Anheuser-Busch to launch the first mainstream gluten-free product into the marketplace, Redbridge gluten-free beer.

We’ve made gluten-free food more available and affordable with our launch of the first-ever gluten-free expo, Appetite for Awareness. Beyond Celiac strives to be problem solvers who tackle the issues our community faces, and when we heard from you that this disease needed to be taken more seriously, we launched our *Seriously Celiac* PSA. We also heard from you that our family members were reluctant to get tested, so we created and launched Talk. Tell. Test., reaching more than 30,000 people in our community and helping them have a serious conversation about celiac disease with their family members. Our videos have had over 1 million impressions on YouTube. We continue to partner with Comcast/NBCUniversal in running a 30-second awareness PSA, made with real celiac disease patients, that has aired nearly a quarter of a million times in the last 3 years.

In addition, our website and social channels have attracted over 25 million visitors. Our YouTube channel alone has garnered 300,000 views, and our *Celiac Straight Talk* podcast has been downloaded 100,000 times. Moreover, tens of thousands of individuals have participated in our Town Halls, virtual conferences and webinars, seeking accurate and evidence-based information on managing the gluten-free diet amidst the proliferation of inaccuracies surrounding celiac disease and gluten sensitivity on the internet.

We also heard from researchers that they needed more patients to move clinical trials forward for treatments, so we started recruiting for and assisting trials. In the last few years, we have referred thousands of patients to trials across the US and seen a number of trials move on to the next phase of clinical research.

We saw that research for celiac disease was underfunded, so we jumped in and have so far committed $3.1 million for research grants to accelerate research for treatments and a cure.

And we’ve directly contributed to the collection of patient-reported data in the form of 14,693 completed research surveys in our Go Beyond Celiac patient registry. From this and other research, Beyond Celiac has had five abstracts/peer-reviewed studies published/accepted in 2022-2023 alone!

You said your voice wasn’t being heard, so we started collecting stories through our award-winning [Voices of Celiac](https://www.beyondceliac.org/voices-of-celiac-disease/) initiative. So far we’ve collected hundreds of diagnosis stories.

These are just a few of our accomplishments, and we couldn’t have done it without YOU and your support! The support of our community keeps us moving toward a cure.

Rest assured, we aren’t slowing down anytime soon. To celebrate 20 years of stepping up for celiac disease, we’re hosting our annual [Step Beyond Celiac 5K](https://stepbeyondceliac23.funraise.org/) this month, where we’ll come together virtually to raise awareness and funds for celiac disease research. But that’s not all! We’re also joining forces with other global celiac organizations to light up landmarks green for awareness in a joint [Shine a Light on Celiac](https://shinealightonceliac.org/) campaign. Notable landmarks being lit for celiac awareness on May 16 include Niagara Falls, the Quebec Olympic Stadium, and the Christ the Redeemer statue in Brazil! We hope you’ll join us in spreading awareness and getting involved in other ways too.

Additional ways you can help spread awareness are by sharing our social media posts, learning more about [Celiac Awareness Month](https://www.beyondceliac.org/celiac-awareness-month/), signing up for our 5K, [donating to research](https://beyondceliac.funraise.org/), helping light up a building with our Shine a Light campaign, [sharing your diagnosis story](https://www.beyondceliac.org/voices-of-celiac-disease/tell-your-story/), or joining a [clinical ](https://www.beyondceliac.org/research/clinical-trials/)[trial](https://www.beyondceliac.org/research/clinical-trials/). These are fantastic ways to support the celiac disease community and Beyond Celiac.

Thank you for your continued dedication to and passion for raising awareness and advancing research for celiac disease. Happy Celiac Awareness Month!

As always, TOGETHER for a cure,

"So, 11 years ago I was in college and was having bad stomach issues (amongst other things) and my stepmom suggested going gf because her mom has Celiac and it sounds like it. Well, it helped a with all of my issues within days. So fast forward and  I hadn’t been eating it for 8 months when my (former) Dr ordered the blood test and explicitly told me I didn’t need to be eating it. Now, I was only 22 at the time and knew nothing about Celiac. We now know that is a load of bull and it obviously came back negative. Years go by and every doctor I have just tells me to not eat it so I don’t have to go through the pain of testing again. I also took a 23 and me health and I have a gene present for Celiac. Well, I’ve been thinking and I would like to have an actual diagnosis on my chart for a couple reasons, but one of them is so I can participate in clinical trials. Well, my current GP ordered the test and I can start eating it. The problem: I’m terrified. I have bad reactions to even cross contamination now.

"I am pretty much positive I get this from my dad and that his mother likely also had it. The man will never get tested or even try going gluten free despite nearly dying multiple times now. My grandmother ended up with colon cancer and was too fragile to treat it. She had issues with malnutrition her entire life and the family just chalked it up to poor diet. She also had early onset osteoporosis and congestive heart failure as well. Her, my dad, two uncles, and I all have severe vitamin deficiencies as well. 

One of my symptoms is that my gut basically stops moving when I’m glutened, bordering on gastroparesis in how severe it gets. I’ve ended up in the ER dozens of times because I can go weeks without any movement. Record was 3 weeks and let me tell you that is painful. Then I swing the other direction and just have heinous diarrhea. My dad is the same, except he actually got to the point he had a perforated bowel, nearly died, had to have a colostomy bag for 6 months, and now every few months is back in the hospital because he just stops moving again. 

My dad is one of 7 kids, three of his siblings have had extreme digestive issues their whole lives and the lot of them all insist it’s random ingredients but avoiding them doesn’t help. So many family gatherings have the traditional complaint session about their intestines and pain, yet the lot of them won’t consider diagnostics so I’m the first person with any official reason why. 

I had a bit of an abridged gluten challenge because I took a canceled appointment slot literally the day after my birthday. I only had 3 weeks of gluten as a result. Still a clear positive though. I had some symptoms that were progressively getting worse beyond everything freezing up, I also have fibromyalgia and a connective tissue disorder and gluten flares my whole body pain up. I was actively losing mobility, my hair was falling out, crazy cognitive brain fog issues, periods of frequent vomiting, severe intestinal pain, skin rashes that wouldn’t go away, brittle nails,had been fighting a 3 year long oral thrush infection, it was just a lot of really awful stuff.

Even if we don’t have celiac we at the very least have it’s ugly cousin NCGS which is just as bad, if not worse according to some scientists.

"Hello all. 

This post will provide more in-depth information about one of the many celiac disease clinical trials going on right now (Solutions for Celiac), to help you determine if it is something you want to consider. We will explain the overall study design, why the research is needed, the activities participants will be asked to do, the time commitment needed, address risks and benefits, and how to get involved

Some of you may have participated in clinical trials before or be new to clinical trials. As seen over the past year, with enough support from companies, regulatory authorities, and widespread public participation, new therapies can be tested, authorized or approved, and made available to those who need it quickly and safely.

**Study Sponsor**

This study is being sponsored by a clinical stage company called ImmunogenX. Their sole mission is to make products that address the needs of those with celiac disease.

The company was founded by a woman who was diagnosed with celiac disease herself, Jennifer Sealey-Voyskner. Since her diagnosis she has dedicated her life to bettering the lives of those who suffer from the same condition. 

**Study in a Nutshell**

The trial is seeing whether adding a medication called latiglutenase to one's diet can reduce the symptoms of accidental gluten consumption. The major symptoms being followed is abdominal pain and bloating, but the study will also look at brain fog, nausea, tiredness, and bowel movement. 

Participation involves up to 6 visits over 26 weeks. Each visit takes about 1-2 hours, and visits are scheduled 1 to 1.5 months apart. 

In addition to compensation for participation, travel reimbursement is provided and is discussed with the study coordinators at enrollment.

**Study Medication**

The medication is investigational, meaning it has not yet been cleared or approved by the FDA. Trials are done on medications like this to gather scientific evidence to help the FDA determine whether the medication is safe and effective for use and thus receive approval.

The study medication is called ""latiglutenase"". It is formulated as a powder that you mix into water with a flavoring packet and drink with meals. Think of it like a medicated flavored water enhancer. In this study, you will be asked to take it 3 times a day - with your breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 

**Qualifications**

The team is looking for people that meet certain criteria to join.  You must be between 18 and 80 years old, have your celiac disease confirmed by an endoscopic biopsy, have been on a gluten-free diet for at least 12 months, have experienced at least moderate severity symptoms associated with gluten exposure in the past month, and have a positive celiac antibody panel at the first visit. 

This list is not exhaustive and additional criteria apply which will be checked when you speak with the study team about enrolling.

**Study Events & Timeline**

This study asks you to come in for up to 6 in-person visits over 26 weeks. At the initial pre-screening visit, you will be told the risks & benefits, all study details, and asked to give written consent to participate. You will provide a blood sample to test for positive celiac serology.

In between visits, you will be asked to complete a daily diary reporting on your celiac-related symptoms. You will periodically collect and store a urine sample at home. 

You will not be asked to undergo any biopsies, injections or infusions, no surgeries or other invasive procedures. You will also be asked to eat a snack once a week for 17 weeks that alternates between gluten-containing and gluten-free.

"They are referring to how many (\~30% depending on study) don't heal fully despite being on a self-reported strict GFD. I think if you skulk around this subreddit for a while, you'll see that there's a pretty wide corridor on what people with celiac disease consider sufficiently strict, and that there is considerable variability in what MDs/RDs/patient advocacy groups recommend. Some people say ""eat out wherever, just inform your server"" and some people say ""eat nothing but your own cooking from single ingredient foods.""

Personally, I'd be interested in seeing a machine learning style investigation of which (if any) specific self-reported standards (eg. eat ""no gluten ingredients"" food, shared kitchen etc.) correlate to healing/lack thereof. 

That said, I'm probably on what one would call the more ""paranoid"" side, and I still struggle more than I would like with occasional lowgrade CC.

The exception has been this past year with the pandemic.

I was trying to find more information about the study and I found this article from Beyond Celiac in 2018, describing the study, and a presentation at CDDW 2019 (Canada Digestive Disease Week) that had a lot of interesting information in it:

\- ""Celiac disease researchers examine the content of patients’ doggie bags"" article: [https://www.beyondceliac.org/research-news/celiac-disease-researchers-examine-the-content-of-patients-doggie-bags/](https://www.beyondceliac.org/research-news/celiac-disease-researchers-examine-the-content-of-patients-doggie-bags/)

\- ""Are we close to a pharmacological therapy for Celiac Disease?"" presentation (the link is to a PDF from PowerPoint slides that I think were presented March of 2019): [https://www.cag-acg.org/images/cddw/pharmacological-therapy-for-celiac\_kelly.pdf](https://www.cag-acg.org/images/cddw/pharmacological-therapy-for-celiac_kelly.pdf)

Also, my GI told me earlier this month about this product that performs urine or stool analysis looking for gluten, in order to determine if you've been exposed, which was also linked in the Beyond Celiac piece: [https://www.beyondceliac.org/research-news/at-home-urine-and-stool-tests-that-detect-gluten-now-available/](https://www.beyondceliac.org/research-news/at-home-urine-and-stool-tests-that-detect-gluten-now-available/)

One comment on the study: it looks like the sample included 21 people from Manitoba. That seems like a small sample size?

Also, if you're interested in drug development for Celiac Disease, check out the PDF presentation: it includes information on all the clinical trials currently underway (presumably accurate as of March 2019). The presentation also talks about how difficult it is to maintain a strict Gluten Free diet and states flatly that it's impossible to do so without ingesting some amount of gluten periodically. There's also an interesting comment that people suffering from the disease are attractive to pharmaceutical companies because they would be lifetime consumers of a drug treating the disease, which reminded me of the controversy over sometimes extortive pricing for insulin.

Lastly, here's a chart from Beyond Celiac on drugs in development for the disease:

"Also, the Beyond Celiac article on the study included the following paragraph:

>As researchers work on final results, they are looking at the association between evident gluten exposure, the results of anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) blood tests and intestinal damage shown through biopsies.

This gets at an ambiguity I see here sometimes when people use the word ""sensitivity"" (not in the scientific sense). It seems to me that there are three types of sensitivity:

\- Sensitive to the effects of gluten exposure (feeling symptoms, in other words).

\- Blood tests showing the effects of gluten exposure (tTG, etc.). For instance, my GI stated that small amounts of exposure to gluten *are not* thought to show a measurable response on these tests. This makes sense, because the gluten challenge is usually recommended to be between two to six weeks of consuming two slices of bread.

\- Intestinal damage appearing as a result of gluten exposure.

It seems to me that when people use the word ""sensitive"" they are sometimes conflating these three things, when it's not clear how they're related. In other words, someone may consume trace amounts of gluten and feel symptoms, but that may not show up on a blood test and may or may not result in intestinal damage.

I don't know what I think about it anymore. One big thing in the interview is that people that participated felt like it was a good time to try things they weren't sure was gluten free. That would skew the results. Also all this talk of ppm gluten when the important thing for healing is total amount in mg. Also was the testing of the food samples even accurate and appropriate? 

I sort of wonder if there is a bias from pharmaceutical companies and accociated researchers to push this idea that you can't ever know if your gluten free or if that is even enough to heal - so you need to buy a drug for the rest of your life obviously. 

Other studies (that might have their own biases) have found good correlation between healing and intake of gluten:

"> In other words, someone may consume trace amounts of gluten and feel symptoms, but that may not show up on a blood test and may or may not result in intestinal damage. 

There are multiple studies out there on trace amounts and intestinal damage, and the smallest amount I've seen tested so far was 10 mg, which caused a measurable reaction in some of the patients (over a relatively short period of time, as well).

I know that in discussion of previous studies of the impact of small amounts of gluten in the diet, a big issue has been that the 'background' ingestion and cross contamination level is high enough (and variable enough) that it is difficult to isolate the amounts they are using. In other words, if you are trying to do a longterm study on the effects of 10 mg of gluten, but some of your patients are getting an average of 5 mg per day from their regular lives, and others are getting 20 mg per day...

I feel like I've also seen a study that talked about the connection between symptoms and damage and they concluded that a lack of symptoms doesn't mean damage is being done, but that the presence of symptoms is a strong indicator that damage is being done (unfortunately, though, you need to make sure those symptoms are actually being caused by gluten, and not simply unrelated).",3,word someone may consume trace amount gluten feel symptom may show blood test may may result intestinal damage multiple study trace amount intestinal damage smallest amount seen tested far mg caused measurable reaction patient relatively short period time well know discussion previous study impact small amount gluten diet big issue background ingestion cross contamination level high enough variable enough difficult isolate amount using word trying longterm study effect mg gluten patient getting average mg per day regular life others getting mg per day feel like also seen study talked connection symptom damage concluded lack symptom mean damage done presence symptom strong indicator damage done unfortunately though need make sure symptom actually caused gluten simply unrelated,sadness

By the way, I think the study was funded in part by the company that makes the urine/stool gluten detection toolkit, which is probably why it's so short: they're interested in showing efficacy of the tool more than the results of long-term adherence to the diet.",1,reddit discussion linked pretty good thanks pointing mentioned accuracy read urine sample detect large amount gluten whereas stool sample sensitive thus urine sample detected gluten study participant consumed detectable level gluten time whereas stool sample detected case way think study funded part company make urine stool gluten detection toolkit probably short interested showing efficacy tool result long term adherence diet,joy

For example, we've seen prior studies showing that over 30% of ""gluten free"" food at restaurants actually has detectable amounts of gluten in it, so if everyone in the study went out to eat just twice during the time period, we'd expect to see at least 60% of the cohort ""glutened"" (just from that one vector of exposure).",2,careful gluten free dieter taking risk usual think tread area debate constantly raging normal v overly cautious example seen prior study showing gluten free food restaurant actually detectable amount gluten everyone study went eat twice time period expect see least cohort glutened one vector exposure,fear

If people change their eating pattern during these 10 days it’s no wonder they don’t see any correlation between healing and gluten exposure.

I just recently joined the sub-reddit, and I've been more of a casual browser on Reddit than an active user. But I reach out to you today, because as a member of this channel I'm sure we all share at least one common interest, and that's Clinical Trials. 

I myself am based out of Tokyo, and am a rookie in the field, but I am really motivated and impassioned about the topic!

My objective is simple. With people being a little more in tune with clinical trial information (COVID pushing it into the public eye and radar a lot more), I feel like this is an ideal time to make some information accessible. I'm not talking about fantastic 3 hour seminars on YouTube that industry professionals would enjoy. I'm thinking a little more PR, layman, pop-science access to the massive mountain of information and complexity that is clinical trials.  It be cool to have non-corporate・non-PR industry perspectives, or fire side chat, or dialogue, or breakdowns for people to share. 

Part of it has been planning and thinking about what people would like, or what may be easier to create, who to best reach out to, but it's been wasting valuable time. The best thing is to just start something and get the ball rolling. Hence this post to you guys (and gals) in the hopes of starting a thread of ideas, or topics, opinions, or even dissent about this idea.

The second link indicates that the reason for the lack of info is that the page is blocked by Robots.txt, and indeed, your robots.txt file contains:Disallow: /ct2/which matches [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04510324](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04510324), and so search engines don't index it properly because you are blocking access to it.  
Also, this poor result is an improvement over the situation a few months ago, when the result was:

" Once on the market, the drug remains closely monitored. It will be monitored under real conditions of use to detect rare side effects or late complications. It can therefore be withdrawn from the market at any time. Among the many molecules tested, those concerning oncology occupy a prominent place. In this field, Canada is also participating in almost one in five trials initiated around the world.

  
**Cancer: the hope of clinical trials**

  
In Villejuif, in the Paris region, the Gustave Roussy Institute is a major center with numerous clinical trials that advance cancer research.  
Patients included in a research protocol must first sign a consent form. This document provides, among other things, informed information on the product tested, the precise course of the test and the risks of side effects.  
For the PEMBIB clinical trial, the patient first takes a blood test and an electrocardiogram. 

The results are transmitted after a few hours and if the parameters are good, the patient can receive the drug. It is tested on different types of cancers resistant to conventional care and even to some advanced treatments like immunotherapy.

  
""Immunotherapies have transformed some cancerous diseases. But unfortunately, not for a majority of patients. The current challenge is to try to make sure that some patients who do not respond to these immunotherapies alone can respond with the combination of two treatments, "". The first treatment removes the blood vessels of the tumor to allow the second treatment to penetrate better into the heart of the tumor area in order to optimize the effect of immunotherapy.

  
Nearly 70 patients participate in this research protocol. And it is thanks to these numerous clinical trials that the Gustave Roussy Institute has contributed to the development of advanced treatment in oncology: ""There are pathologies where there is therapeutic progress to be made because they are difficult to understand and to understand like cancer of the pancreas, cancer of the brain ... But by better understanding these tumors in the coming years, we will continue to progress, ""says Professor Gilles Vassal, director of clinical research.

  
Every year, more than 3,000 patients participate in clinical trials at [Clinical Research & CRO Companies Canada](https://www.biopharmaservices.com/). The Institute remains the leading center for the fight against cancer on a European scale.

  
**Epidermolysis bullosa: a life-changing clinical trial**

  
The other area very concerned by clinical trials is that of rare diseases. 95% of those affected are wandering therapeutically and only 300 curative treatments are available for 8,000 patients affected by a rare disease. These clinical trials are therefore very important.

  
The epidermolysis bullosa affects about 10,000 people in Canada, causes sores, extremely painful skin abrasions. Some forms of the disease also affect the inside of the mouth but also the esophagus, sometimes causing its narrowing with a deadly risk. Patients are currently testing an ointment in a clinical trial.

  
For this clinical trial, patients receive a daily visit from a nurse who applies the treatment and carries out the care. The mode of action of the cream remains confidential but its effects are very visible. The laboratory plans to include 80 patients in the nine countries involved in the two-year clinical trial.

  
Sick or healthy, anyone can be asked to participate in a clinical trial. This proposal can occur during a consultation with the doctor, but also by an announcement in the media. You can also volunteer independently, by contacting structures dedicated to clinical research, such as Inserm's clinical investigation centers (CIC) for example.",1,market drug remains closely monitored monitored real condition use detect rare side effect late complication therefore withdrawn market time among many molecule tested concerning oncology occupy prominent place field canada also participating almost one five trial initiated around world cancer hope clinical trial villejuif paris region gustave roussy institute major center numerous clinical trial advance cancer research patient included research protocol must first sign consent form document provides among thing informed information product tested precise course test risk side effect pembib clinical trial patient first take blood test electrocardiogram result transmitted hour parameter good patient receive drug tested different type cancer resistant conventional care even advanced treatment like immunotherapy immunotherapy transformed cancerous disease unfortunately majority patient current challenge try make sure patient respond immunotherapy alone respond combination two treatment first treatment remove blood vessel tumor allow second treatment penetrate better heart tumor area order optimize effect immunotherapy nearly patient participate research protocol thanks numerous clinical trial gustave roussy institute contributed development advanced treatment oncology pathology therapeutic progress made difficult understand understand like cancer pancreas cancer brain better understanding tumor coming year continue progress say professor gilles vassal director clinical research every year patient participate clinical trial clinical research cro company canada institute remains leading center fight cancer european scale epidermolysis bullosa life changing clinical trial area concerned clinical trial rare disease affected wandering therapeutically curative treatment available patient affected rare disease clinical trial therefore important epidermolysis bullosa affect people canada cause sore extremely painful skin abrasion form disease also affect inside mouth also esophagus sometimes causing narrowing deadly risk patient currently testing ointment clinical trial clinical trial patient receive daily visit nurse applies treatment carry care mode action cream remains confidential effect visible laboratory plan include patient nine country involved two year clinical trial sick healthy anyone asked participate clinical trial proposal occur consultation doctor also announcement medium also volunteer independently contacting structure dedicated clinical research inserm clinical investigation center cic example,anger

"There are different types of clinical trials including the ones that follow.

The **clinical trials** to assess new treatments or new ways to make them more effective existing treatments. You can study new drugs or new methods to perform surgery or administer radiotherapy, for example. This is the type of clinical trial in which people with cancer participate most frequently.

The **prevention trials** to assess new ways to reduce the risk of cancer or prevent it from reappearing.

The **screening trials** help to find ways to detect cancer early in humans, before they experience symptoms.

The **diagnostic tests** used to find better ways to diagnose cancer or to determine the stage.

The **trials supportive care** possible to find ways to improve comfort and quality of life for people with cancer or cancer survivors.

## Phases of a clinical trial

The clinical trial that involves a new treatment always takes place in several stages called phases. Each phase is designed to answer specific questions. The following are the most common phases of a cancer clinical trial, as per [Canada Contract Research Organization](https://www.biopharmaservices.com/).

In **phase 1** , a new treatment is often evaluated for the first time in humans. This helps to know how safe it is and what is the best dose to administer. The Phase 1 trial is usually offered to people with advanced cancer who no longer respond to treatment or who have no other treatment options. In general, 15 to 30 people participate in the phase 1 trial.

In **Phase 2** , the degree of effectiveness of a treatment against a certain type of cancer is demonstrated. The extent to which the treatment is safe and the possible side effects continue to be assessed. In general, fewer than 100 people participate in the Phase 2 trial.

In **Phase 3** , a promising new treatment is compared to standard therapy, which is the recognized treatment that is generally given for a condition or illness. Researchers especially want to know if the new treatment is better than the standard treatment. People from around the world can participate in a Phase 3 trial. In general, the number of participants ranges from several hundred to several thousand.

In **Phase 4** , more information is collected on the possible effects of treatment, whether good or bad, after its use has been approved in Canada. In general, several hundred to several thousand people participate in the phase 4 trial.

## Randomized clinical trials

The clinical trial can be designed to include different groups. Most of the time, there are 2 groups, but you can count more. One group is the control group, that is, the participants do not receive the study treatment. The other group is the experimental group, that is, the participants receive the treatment under study.

To make sure groups can be compared, it's a computer that randomly assigns each person to a group. You are as lucky to be part of the experimental group as the control group. This is called randomization.

There are 2 types of randomization.

For **blind randomization** , researchers know who is in the experimental group and who is in the control group, but study participants are unaware of this. This prevents them from doing things that could affect the results of the study.

For **double-blind randomization, trial** participants do not know which group they belong to, just like the researchers. In the field of science, the design of this study seems to be the best since neither researchers nor participants can affect the results of the study by doing things they think they should do depending on the group.

## Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials

Placebo is a pill or injection that looks like the tested substance but has no action at all. Administering a placebo to one of the clinical trial groups allows the researchers to compare the new placebo treatment. No placebo is administered instead of effective standard therapy. In a trial, for example, a new treatment associated with standard treatment with a placebo associated with the standard treatment can be compared. This tells researchers if the new treatment is effective.

Placebo is given in double-blind trials. You will be told if a trial is using a placebo, but you will not know if you are in the placebo group or the researchers elsewhere.",6,different type clinical trial including one follow clinical trial ass new treatment new way make effective existing treatment study new drug new method perform surgery administer radiotherapy example type clinical trial people cancer participate frequently prevention trial ass new way reduce risk cancer prevent reappearing screening trial help find way detect cancer early human experience symptom diagnostic test used find better way diagnose cancer determine stage trial supportive care possible find way improve comfort quality life people cancer cancer survivor phase clinical trial clinical trial involves new treatment always take place several stage called phase phase designed answer specific question following common phase cancer clinical trial per canada contract research organization phase new treatment often evaluated first time human help know safe best dose administer phase trial usually offered people advanced cancer longer respond treatment treatment option general people participate phase trial phase degree effectiveness treatment certain type cancer demonstrated extent treatment safe possible side effect continue assessed general fewer people participate phase trial phase promising new treatment compared standard therapy recognized treatment generally given condition illness researcher especially want know new treatment better standard treatment people around world participate phase trial general number participant range several hundred several thousand phase information collected possible effect treatment whether good bad use approved canada general several hundred several thousand people participate phase trial randomized clinical trial clinical trial designed include different group time group count one group control group participant receive study treatment group experimental group participant receive treatment study make sure group compared computer randomly assigns person group lucky part experimental group control group called randomization type randomization blind randomization researcher know experimental group control group study participant unaware prevents thing could affect result study double blind randomization trial participant know group belong like researcher field science design study seems best since neither researcher participant affect result study thing think depending group placebo controlled clinical trial placebo pill injection look like tested substance action administering placebo one clinical trial group allows researcher compare new placebo treatment placebo administered instead effective standard therapy trial example new treatment associated standard treatment placebo associated standard treatment compared tell researcher new treatment effective placebo given double blind trial told trial using placebo know placebo group researcher elsewhere,joy
"What an excellent post. About the only thing I possibly can add is a mention of Phase 0. From what I've read from various U.S./FDA based descriptions ... ""**Phase 0**: *Exploratory study involving very limited human exposure to the drug, with no therapeutic or diagnostic goals (for example, screening studies, microdose studies)[^](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/help/glossary/phase)*"" and ""*The purpose of this phase is to help speed up and streamline the drug approval process[^](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18199854)*.""

I would mention that there are detractors to this phase, whose concerns are spelled out in this article '[FDA Introduces New Phase 0 for Clinical Trials : Oncology Times](https://journals.lww.com/oncology-times/Fulltext/2006/08100/FDA_Introduces_New_Phase_0_for_Clinical_Trials_.6.aspx?WT.mc_id=HPxADx20100319xMP).'",1,excellent post thing possibly add mention phase read various u fda based description phase exploratory study involving limited human exposure drug therapeutic diagnostic goal example screening study microdose study purpose phase help speed streamline drug approval process would mention detractor phase whose concern spelled article fda introduces new phase clinical trial oncology time,joy

"Context:

* I'm a healthy 25M
* The trial is testing a drug designed to treat narcolepsy (so I think it affects the brain).
* The trial is in NYC, USA and the study is registered on [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/)
* The testing will occur over 3 consecutive days in the hospital.

Although the compensation is very tempting, I don't want to take more than a 1% of long term adverse affects for short term pay. 

P.S. I hate getting blood drawn but am willing to face this fear.

P.S.S. I've never done anything like this before and would really appreciate any insight you can give me <3

"Been seeing more and more of these posts lately, is it because of that one TikTok video with the guy showing off how much he made participating in clinical trials?…

As mentioned, Phase 1 trials are very focused on safety which does usually mean a lot of PK and ADA samples (EX: blood draws pre-dose, post-dose, 1 hour post-dose, 8 hour post-dose, etc.), ECGs, etc. You’ll be poked and prodded a lot but the whole basis of the trial is that they believe it to be safe. You are essentially a guinea pig, but it’s not like they’re just guessing here. You’ll likely be asked to complete some sort of follow-up, but it could just be a few quick phone calls to confirm if you’re still feeling alright. 

No one here or at the study site can guarantee you won’t experience any adverse events (side effects), but there is a reason they’re doing this in a hospital setting. You’ll have essentially around the clock observation. Read the informed consent thoroughly and ASK QUESTIONS, that’s what the study team is there for - they should be able to address any concerns before, during and after.",49,seeing post lately one tiktok video guy showing much made participating clinical trial mentioned phase trial focused safety usually mean lot pk ada sample ex blood draw pre dose post dose hour post dose hour post dose etc ecg etc poked prodded lot whole basis trial believe safe essentially guinea pig like guessing likely asked complete sort follow could quick phone call confirm still feeling alright one study site guarantee experience adverse event side effect reason hospital setting essentially around clock observation read informed consent thoroughly ask question study team able address concern,joy
"Phase 1 is all about safety, so keep that in mind. They’ve established a good proof of concept with animal models, but it’s never been in humans. So, they THINK it’s safe, but the purpose of the trial is to prove it.",52,phase safety keep mind established good proof concept animal model never human think safe purpose trial prove,joy
"I would definitely ask to the consent form to read in advance (typically they’ll be able to email it to you). Not liking blood draws is kinda a deal-breaker for many- there are some where you’ll have your blood drawn 10x or more. If you didn’t mind having your blood drawn, participating in a Phase 1 study would be a lot more approachable, but it might be one of the most important parts of the study. If getting your blood drawn is stressful to you, I could definitely see skipping Phase I trials.

More about the study:
- You’ll check in for the designated time- you won’t get to come/go as you please
- You might be asked to eat a standardized meal or pick from a standard menu at certain times
- when it is time to get your blood drawn, you’ll get your blood drawn. This could mean a nurse waking you up at 2am and 6am to poke you.
- Typically, you’ll be around other people 
- you have a right to leave/change your mind at any time
- every phase 1 trial is different so one person’s experience may not apply to you. There will be experienced participants there that will tell you stories about what’s typical, but don’t count on one trial being exactly like another",12,would definitely ask consent form read advance typically able email liking blood draw kinda deal breaker many blood drawn x mind blood drawn participating phase study would lot approachable might one important part study getting blood drawn stressful could definitely see skipping phase trial study check designated time get come go please might asked eat standardized meal pick standard menu certain time time get blood drawn get blood drawn could mean nurse waking poke typically around people right leave change mind time every phase trial different one person experience may apply experienced participant tell story typical count one trial exactly like another,joy
"So I’m working on a trial that includes Phase I dose escalation. Four dose levels, test the first in ten patients, no dose limiting toxicities, move onto the next. We watch that data like a freaking hawk.

What you can expect?  
- A very high focus on pharmacovigilence- aka safety. You will be prodded and poked, asked about adverse events and potentially sent for scans like CT’s depending on the drug. Check the schedule of events and follow up expectations.
- Everything will be in your Patient Information Sheet, so read it. And ask questions. That’s what the clinical staff are there for. If something worries you, ask them.

"I've been managing phase 1 for years. If this is an ascending dose study, where they test progressively higher doses in each group, ask which group you are being slated for, and how many groups  in total are planned. This will give you an idea of where you may land in the progression, and therefore a general idea of the probability of adverse effects ie if you are in group 8 out of 10 planned, you may be getting a higher dose and therefore possibly have more side effects.  Ask the name of the drug and look it up. Ask them to send you a copy of the consent form.

"Everyone else has covered most of what I consider. I usually start with the least flexible items first, either as defined by the protocol or by my site (e.g., snagging an MRI slot weeks in advance).

If some assessments are completed on a tablet, I build in extra time for subjects who are older or have physical limitations.

You have to ask who, when, where, and how for each assessment. I worked with another CRC to create a massive OneNote cheat sheet with SOPs, informal processes, contact info, regulatory resources, and miscellaneous, site-specific tips that are usually only passed on by word of mouth.

2. There is an unaffiliated ethics committee to review the protocol before it can start
3. The protocol will often prohibit family members from enrolling

"My fellow undergraduate researchers and I at The Ohio State University recently heard a story on a personal story on LinkedIn. It recounted the experience of a patient's mother who, upon learning from a doctor that her child had no available treatments, was advised to explore clinical trials. Unfortunately, the doctor provided minimal guidance in navigating the intricate process of finding the appropriate clinical trial. This has prompted us to question whether such scenarios are a common challenge for patients compelled to consider clinical trials as a potential option.

It's crucial to recognize that doctors likely do not harbor malicious intentions when they fall short of offering guidance in these situations. Factors such as time constraints or ethical considerations may contribute to their difficulty in providing comprehensive assistance. The hesitation to recommend a specific clinical trial without certainty may stem from a desire to avoid steering patients in the wrong direction, potentially leading to unsuccessful outcomes and a lack of patient retention. 

If you or a loved one has experience navigating the clinical trial process, we would love to hear your feedback. We would also be interested in hearing from anyone professionally involved in the clinical trial process (ie. physicians, NPs, PAs, etc).

"My department had our meeting before the Christmas break and the university came back with reports that our minority recruitment doesn’t match up with the area we live. Now we all know we aren’t not talking to patients based on ethnicity. Couldn’t care less🤦‍♀️. The problem we see is still the general distrust of medicine, which I just want to reiterate I totally understand. The training we all have to take literally goes over what we did to people so it does not get repeated. I’m sick with something else myself and the treatment I receive as a patient vs the treatment I get when I have my research badge and scrubs on is NIGHT AND DAY. I essentially cry at every doctors appointment so all my doctors think I’m full of shit and just need to go on mental meds. 

The field I’m currently working in, by the time the patients come to see the doctor, their disease is way too late stage and we can’t offer them anything but support. I personally think it needs to start WAY before the research level and just generally helping out these groups of people that don’t trust the US healthcare system. We need general community outreach navigators that help people get into a PCP, and get assessed. Insurance now covers yearly CT scans if you smoke, and NONE of these patients take advantage of it because they don’t even know it exists. A trial navigator would definitely be helpful and necessary, but we need to get them to go seek medical care in the first place.",2,department meeting christmas break university came back report minority recruitment match area live know talking patient based ethnicity care le problem see still general distrust medicine want reiterate totally understand training take literally go people get repeated sick something else treatment receive patient v treatment get research badge scrub night day essentially cry every doctor appointment doctor think full shit need go mental med field currently working time patient come see doctor disease way late stage offer anything support personally think need start way research level generally helping group people trust u healthcare system need general community outreach navigator help people get pcp get assessed insurance cover yearly ct scan smoke none patient take advantage even know exists trial navigator would definitely helpful necessary need get go seek medical care first place,anger

"There’s a lot of heterogeneity in trial access for different therapeutic areas and/or drug types. For example, there is comparatively good trial identification and patient recruitment infrastructure for molecularly targeted cancer therapies. There are widely used commercial tests for molecular targets that will append a list of trials targeting any identified alterations to the report. So the doc gets a report that says their patient’s tumor has X, Y, Z mutations, and here is a list of open trials for drugs targeting those mutations. 

On the other hand, for rare diseases or relatively underfunded diseases it might be entirely up to the treating physician to proactively look for trials on websites like clinicaltrials.gov.

"Sorry, but no-one had responded and I couldn't resist so I copied your post verbatim to ChatGPT and got the following response:

""Yes, there's considerable ongoing work in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications for clinical trial management. AI technologies hold significant promise in streamlining various aspects of clinical trials, including patient recruitment, trial design, data analysis, and regulatory compliance.

Several organizations, both in academia and industry, are actively researching and implementing AI solutions in clinical trial management. Some areas of focus include:

1. **Patient Recruitment and Retention:** AI algorithms can analyze patient data from various sources to identify potential participants who meet specific trial criteria. Additionally, AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can engage with patients to provide information and support throughout the trial, potentially improving retention rates.
2. **Trial Design Optimization:** AI can analyze historical trial data to optimize trial design, including selecting appropriate endpoints, sample sizes, and patient populations. This can lead to more efficient and cost-effective trials.
3. **Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling:** AI techniques such as machine learning and natural language processing can analyze large volumes of clinical data to identify trends, predict outcomes, and uncover insights that may inform decision-making during the trial.
4. **Regulatory Compliance and Risk Management:** AI systems can assist in ensuring regulatory compliance by automating documentation processes, flagging potential risks or protocol deviations, and streamlining reporting requirements.
5. **Drug Development:** AI-driven approaches are also being applied to drug discovery and development, including the identification of novel drug targets, drug repurposing, and the prediction of drug safety and efficacy.

To connect with professionals working in this field and stay updated on the latest developments, you may consider:

* Joining professional associations and networks related to clinical research and AI, such as the Society for Clinical Trials or the International Society for Clinical Biostatistics.
* Attending conferences, workshops, and webinars focused on AI in healthcare and clinical trials.
* Engaging with researchers and practitioners on platforms like LinkedIn, ResearchGate, or specialized forums and discussion groups.
* Exploring academic literature and industry publications for insights into current research and industry initiatives.

By actively participating in these activities and reaching out to professionals in the field, you can gain valuable knowledge and insights into the intersection of AI and clinical trial management.""",3,sorry one responded resist copied post verbatim chatgpt got following response yes considerable ongoing work field artificial intelligence ai application clinical trial management ai technology hold significant promise streamlining various aspect clinical trial including patient recruitment trial design data analysis regulatory compliance several organization academia industry actively researching implementing ai solution clinical trial management area focus include patient recruitment retention ai algorithm analyze patient data various source identify potential participant meet specific trial criterion additionally ai powered chatbots virtual assistant engage patient provide information support throughout trial potentially improving retention rate trial design optimization ai analyze historical trial data optimize trial design including selecting appropriate endpoint sample size patient population lead efficient cost effective trial data analysis predictive modeling ai technique machine learning natural language processing analyze large volume clinical data identify trend predict outcome uncover insight may inform decision making trial regulatory compliance risk management ai system assist ensuring regulatory compliance automating documentation process flagging potential risk protocol deviation streamlining reporting requirement drug development ai driven approach also applied drug discovery development including identification novel drug target drug repurposing prediction drug safety efficacy connect professional working field stay updated latest development may consider joining professional association network related clinical research ai society clinical trial international society clinical biostatistics attending conference workshop webinars focused ai healthcare clinical trial engaging researcher practitioner platform like linkedin researchgate specialized forum discussion group exploring academic literature industry publication insight current research industry initiative actively participating activity reaching professional field gain valuable knowledge insight intersection ai clinical trial management,joy

Once we have something that looks pretty awesome, isn’t toxic to animals/cells then it goes through a bunch of other studies before being tested on humans.

"The VAST majority of drugs fail. Many of them simply don’t work to help treat the disease in question. Others turn out not to be safe. Drugs work differently in different animals, so even very promising animal research rarely makes it to market. Drugs can be very promising in animals but act totally differently in people. We can get an idea, but it’s far from perfect.  That’s why it’s so important to start with extremely low doses and a small number of people JUST to see if a drug is safe, before you even start testing to see if it works.  Your researcher is probably confident it will go to market more due to human psychology and optimism than science. (Though certainly it’s likely that early preclinical testing is showing positive signs. And it’s also possible the compound is similar to others that are on the market and have been successful. So signs are probably encouraging but seriously if she hasn’t even made it into humans yet, “confidence” is laughable.) ",7,vast majority drug fail many simply work help treat disease question others turn safe drug work differently different animal even promising animal research rarely make market drug promising animal act totally differently people get idea far perfect important start extremely low dos small number people see drug safe even start testing see work researcher probably confident go market due human psychology optimism science though certainly likely early preclinical testing showing positive sign also possible compound similar others market successful sign probably encouraging seriously even made human yet confidence laughable,joy
"You really can't be until you test it in humans. 

But before then you can gather evidence by testing it in living tissue or on animals first. Certain proteins, metabolic pathways, and other biological functions can be highly conserved (meaning are kept the same genetically) across species, making a drug or treatment's mechanism of action able to act on non-human animals or in living tissue. 

Since some of these mechanisms of action are similar if not functionally identical to how they work in human biology, you can reasonably infer that at the very least the medication in question isn't outright *harmful* to life first and foremost. From there, you can ascertain enough information that it could improve the lives/symptoms of animals afflicted with a specific kind of disease depending on how you expect the drug to behave. This is measured through observing the test animal's behavior, vitals, labs, and even performing necropsies and taking tissue samples for observations.

Even with all of that, we humans are really complex living creatures! We can communicate symptoms that mice or zebra fish would never be able to, nor would be obvious from a necropsy of a test animal (e.g., nausea, bitter taste after taking medication, etc.) So sure, a medication may perform its function, but it might cause side effects that are so miserable it might as well not work to begin with!",6,really test human gather evidence testing living tissue animal first certain protein metabolic pathway biological function highly conserved meaning kept genetically across specie making drug treatment mechanism action able act non human animal living tissue since mechanism action similar functionally identical work human biology reasonably infer least medication question outright harmful life first foremost ascertain enough information could improve life symptom animal afflicted specific kind disease depending expect drug behave measured observing test animal behavior vitals lab even performing necropsy taking tissue sample observation even human really complex living creature communicate symptom mouse zebra fish would never able would obvious necropsy test animal e g nausea bitter taste taking medication etc sure medication may perform function might cause side effect miserable might well work begin,sadness
"All great points about the differences seen when getting to human testing versus animals, cells, etc. 

But another key point is the impact of study design and study logistics.

Many promising drugs have been brought down by poor study design, bad management, and bad luck. 

Especially in CNS, where things like placebo response can be a very big problem, study design is everything and you have to ensure your primary endpoint measure is well validated and administered. 

But even in the “harder science” areas like cancer, where results are more objective, studies can be negatively impacted by so many factors, including things like enrolling ineligible subjects and having their data scrapped, having too many subjects withdraw too early/lost to follow up, missing endpoints (like scans), etc. 

Having worked first in CNS, it was always stressed to us that a drug can work perfectly, but if the study isn’t well designed and we don’t do our jobs (whether you’re a PI, CRC, Monitor, Medical Monitor, DM, etc) then that drug may never see the light of day.",6,great point difference seen getting human testing versus animal cell etc another key point impact study design study logistics many promising drug brought poor study design bad management bad luck especially cns thing like placebo response big problem study design everything ensure primary endpoint measure well validated administered even harder science area like cancer result objective study negatively impacted many factor including thing like enrolling ineligible subject data scrapped many subject withdraw early lost follow missing endpoint like scan etc worked first cns always stressed u drug work perfectly study well designed job whether pi crc monitor medical monitor dm etc drug may never see light day,sadness

"That’s very interesting you mentioned the metabolic pathways being conserved across specifies. This drug is attempting to stabilize HIF-1A levels and HIF-1A is ubiquitously expressed across mammalian cells. the drug itself is a PHD inhibitor, and there have been a few PHD inhibitors which were approved by FDA so I’m surmising that’s why the researchers are more confident about its safety profile.

The reason I’ve been following this particular drug is that it aims to induce regeneration and has been successful in different systems, from IBD related ulcers to soft tissue/hard tissue regeneration in periodontitis models.

As an example, I had one study where an endpoint was looking at improvement in various neurological scores compared to baseline. In the natural history of the disease we would expect to see progressive decline in scores over time. Trial results showed no change in the scores compared to baseline, and because the endpoint specified they wanted to see improvement, drug approval was rejected by Health agencies several times. 

Was a very unfortunate situation because every study team working on the trial felt that the drug had benefit, as compared to untreated patients, the treated ones were far more stable and either didn't progress during the trial, or progressed much more slowly than would be clinically expected.",3,yup really unfortunate affect outcome drug example one study endpoint looking improvement various neurological score compared baseline natural history disease would expect see progressive decline score time trial result showed change score compared baseline endpoint specified wanted see improvement drug approval rejected health agency several time unfortunate situation every study team working trial felt drug benefit compared untreated patient treated one far stable either progress trial progressed much slowly would clinically expected,sadness

The drug caused an effect on a co-morbidity which killed the patient. The trial was halted, the exclusion criteria changed to include that health condition and the trial re-started. I believe that was a Phase III trial.

It’s also why we treat sequentially in Phase I trials; in cancer trials it’s less of a problem as you don’t treat healthy patients so you have to wait for eligible patients anyway. However, in non cancer trials you don’t give all participants the drug at the same time. You either batch them or do one patient at a time and either wait for them to be completely followed up or stagger them using methods like the ‘time-to-event continual reassessment’.

"I think my only concern is about discussing the medication, which is probably one of the reasons they have household restrictions on a lot of studies. Discussing how you’re feeling on the med so far when you’re both randomized and blinded could influence placebo effect and how you identify your body’s reaction to it and whether it is helping at all. Even if you don’t discuss it, there’s always the possibility one of you is on the drug (or appears to be on the drug) and starts responding, and the other person feels disappointed that they don’t seem to be responding at all. This might lead them to assume they’re on a placebo, even though they might actually be receiving the medication also. Depending on the trial phase I would be nervous about unintentional influence as a researcher/PI, but I’m not an expert. Plus, if your partner has never been treated for OCD before that may also be a limiting criteria. I know I’m currently working on a neurological trial for Tourette’s and all participants are required to have tried and failed a non-pharmacological TD approach in order to be eligible. If your partner has never received diagnosis there’s probably a good possibility he’s never tried meds or CBT for it, and given there are a lot of first-line meds for OCD that can be very effective (like Zoloft), and that it also seems like it might not be severe for him (?), I think you should prioritize yourself on this study. You have more of a medical history for it, and I’m assuming if you’re on the trial that you’ve struggled to pharmacologically manage your symptoms in the past. You’re going to be a better subject for a drug trial than he will be. :) Saying this as someone who is admittedly still relatively new to research but also has diagnosed OCD.

"The way to make your presentation less boring is to make it more relevant to your audience. First thing is make sure the training is relevant to the trainee's role. For example if they're only responsible for storage and accountability, they probably don't care too much about how to operate the device.

Second understand that there's usually a lot of time that passes between the training and when the trainee will use the device on a subject. So even for people who are going to be using the device, the training doesn't feel immediately relevant and they know they're probably going to forget everything you're saying and will need a just-in-time retraining anyway. Focus on making the presentation clear and simple and go over where to look up the step by step instructions and troubleshooting when the trainee needs it.

Lastly, review common errors and what to do if something is wrong. Nurses especially want to feel confident that they know what to do in any possible scenario that could come up.",6,way make presentation le boring make relevant audience first thing make sure training relevant trainee role example responsible storage accountability probably care much operate device second understand usually lot time pass training trainee use device subject even people going using device training feel immediately relevant know probably going forget everything saying need time retraining anyway focus making presentation clear simple go look step step instruction troubleshooting trainee need lastly review common error something wrong nurse especially want feel confident know possible scenario could come,joy

"I think you're misunderstanding how this clinical trial works. You go into a clinical trial at any phase with no guarantee that you will benefit personally from the drug. That's how we figure it out. Sometimes these drugs work, sometimes they don't work as well as they had hoped.

The process of a clinical trial is to determine whether the investigational drug is safe in humans first (pilot/phase 1a), and it seems ethically they studied this drug in healthy individuals rather than the already injured minority population. Now that they found the drug is safe in healthy individuals, they are now seeing what changes they see in target population, injured human subjects (phase 1b). The phase 1b is probably going to try to determine the MTD (maximum tolerated dose) since they didn't hit it in the Phase 1a trial. They'll probably have a dose escalation and dose expansion phases between the two cohorts. This could done concurrently or one dose level at a time for both cohorts.

[This article](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nervgen-pharma-reports-q1-2023-results-and-provides-operational-update-including-clinical-trials-of-proprietary-nvg-291-1b0ef5d4) does an ok job of explaining the trials from an investor point of view, but it talks about what the objectives of the 1b/2a study are in the injured patients:

>""Specifically, the primary objective will be to assess the change in corticospinal connectivity of specific upper and lower extremity muscle groups following treatment, based on changes in motor evoked potential amplitudes. Our secondary objectives will include a number of clinical outcome assessments focusing on motor function and mobility, as well as additional electrophysiological measurements.""

Your question about efficacy is a little hard to answer because it's not a sure thing that it will be efficacious. Here's how to think about it: As they continue to study the drug and dose escalate/expand in phase 1b, they have to meet certain criteria to move to the next step. If they're finding results that support continuing the trial, they'll move to open the phase 2 with even more patients at the dose level(s) they found in the Phase 1b trial worked the best at meeting the study objectives (i.e. changes in connectivity, motor function, etc.)

I'm not sure how fast they will work through the phase 1b part of the study, but I'd imagine the process will take about a year or so to go through all the recruitment, screening, patient visits, the expanding of dose levels and cohorts, and the dreaded data cleaning and analysis. Again, it's hard to know for sure if this will work for the patients that need it until they volunteer and help scientist make that determination.

I can tell you though that recruitment is biggest culprit to delaying of medical advancements. A lot of people don't want to join clinical trials because they don't know if it's going to work. But this thinking is a fallacy. They can only find out if a drug works if people join the trials to figure out whether it does or not.

"A Double-blind study is a method to reduce the chances of bias between the patients and helps ensure fairer treatment across all patients whether or not they’re receiving the drug or placebo. 

I can understand the not wanting to stay in the placebo group, but having the two groups is how scientists figure what changes happen to people who take the drug vs those who don’t. These are very important questions that can’t be studied any other way. 

The dose in humans is a bit different. I don’t work in animal studies, but it seems mouse models can exposed to more drug to see any effects. This would be highly unethical in humans to do. Instead, they dose escalate and monitor the patients at each dose level for any serious adverse events that meet the criteria for the maximum tolerated dose. This should be far before any long-lasting effects are seen, but I don’t know for sure. That’s why they’re doing the study; they need to see what it does in patients with the condition the drug is attempting to treat and if any adverse events are seen. So far they’ve determined it’s safe in healthy humans, but now they need to see what changes are seen in injured patients.

"Big factors are that Belgium is small and you can only select few sites in the country. Each country added at global level is a cost, so trying to limit the number of countries a global study goes to is considered. 
Recruitment potential is another thing. Belgium healthcare and reimbursement is great, meaning that patients have less incentives (monetary) to participate, so that impacts recruitment for some indications. 
Belgium remains attractive because of high quality, trained staff, key opinion leaders and such, but the above factors are likely causing bigger impact on decisions",2,big factor belgium small select site country country added global level cost trying limit number country global study go considered recruitment potential another thing belgium healthcare reimbursement great meaning patient le incentive monetary participate impact recruitment indication belgium remains attractive high quality trained staff key opinion leader factor likely causing bigger impact decision,joy

"I am so conflicted about a decision I need to make by tomorrow. I’ve been an FSP Clinical trials associate at Syneos but working for Bristol Myers Squibb in their office and on their studies, SOPs etc for 1yr5mos now. I really enjoy it here due to the sponsor being BMS, they have great work-life balance and I’m only on 4 studies with study team calls only once a month so I’m able to have time for my hobbies as well as learn new things at a steady pace. The only downside is my manager at Syneos doesn’t know when he can get me onto the CRA training programme to be one at BMS since there haven’t been vacancies out for a while (could be 2 years).

I recently interviewed for the assistant CRA role at PPD which paid the same as what I’m currently on however I landed the CRA level 1 role instead due to my interview going really well. Since it’s a CRO I’m worried that this will involve a high workload and poor work-life balance but Ive heard the management team is really good. I’ve told my LM at syneos and he expressed how he didn’t want me to leave and gave me a chance to re-think about it as he’s worried this new job is just pushing me into the deep end. He also said he’s sure he can get approval to match the salary that they’re offering me at PPD (since it’s quite low at PPD at anyway not so hard lol).

I’m so torn between the two, I’ve already accepted by email the new job (but haven’t completed background screening or signed contract) but I haven’t confirmed with my current LM yet.

"I think there's arguments for both choices and it's not a clear-cut decision.


I personally would stay at BMS and wait it out, because it's very jarring to go from a comfortable FSP position back to frantic full-service. I started full service, then went FSP, told myself I'd never go back to full service but then ended up doing it anyway because of a good offer and thinking ""how bad can it be?"", then regretted that. To top that, learning to be a CRA is hard in any case, so you're making it easier on yourself if it's in an environment where you know the processes, you know some of the people, you know which role does what, etc. 


Of course, if you take the CRA role now (which is currently difficult to get, so well done!) you can progress faster in your career and also increase your earning potential once you have monitoring experience.

"I think working in office directly at a drug company and not traveling, are what a lot of CRAs wish they could do. I would not have wanted to give that up. What would be even better would to be hired directly by BMS instead of Syneos, if that is a future possibility.

I worked at PPD as a CRA. There is no general work life balance or management style. It is the luck of the draw to see which protocol you end up on and which line manager you will get (whom you will not meet until after a couple months).

I have worked for both sponsor biotech companies and for CROs. Moving from a drug company to a CRO was very abrupt in terms of onboarding and training differences. At drug and device companies, they are very careful to train you in a systematic thorough manner, and they have human coworkers to also help show you things.

But in a big CRO, they just throw a hundred random SOPs and videos at you like ""Here - read this! Watch this! Hurry up! They're due in 2 weeks! No, don't bother to read the whole SOP or protocol documents! That will take too much time! Just click the electronic acknowledgement; that's what we need for audit purposes! Why are you asking questions? You said you worked at a drug company before, so if you really did, you shouldn't ever ask any questions and no one has to tell you anything (PPD said this to me when I was brand new). What's wrong with you/ why don't you know SOP 305974 Job Aid 9574 page 36 paragraph 2?? You clicked the acknowledgment so you should have known this information!!

It just feels very insulting to move from biotech to CRO, because since you have a comparison and know better, you know that their training is inappropriate. CROs are also a little more dehumanizing in terms of how they related to their employees. I felt like part of a herd of cattle when I was there.

"Hey r/clinicalresearch! I do not work in the field, but I figured there would be no better place to ask than a subreddit of professionals who do!

I was a patient in a clinical trial for FDA clearance of a medical device for a spinal condition- I had been cleared and approved, signed all of the trial consent paperwork, and had a surgery date scheduled for Dec 29th to have the device placed in my spine. On December 20th, less than 9 days out and after planning my entire life around what would be a major surgery, I find out from my clinician team  that the sponsor has closed enrollment and cancelled my surgery. 

I am absolutely devastated, angry, disappointed, and hopeless all at once and I strongly believed this device would have been life changing for me. There has been no communication from the sponsor whatsoever and their trial page still lists that they are recruiting. I also reached out to the sponsor on Facebook because I had done so months ago to ask information about the trial and received a prompt response- this time they read my message but haven’t since responded.

 My questions for you:

Is this common practice? Is there any chance there’s been a mistake? Should I expect any communication from the sponsor? What would you advise doing in this situation?",24,hey r clinicalresearch work field figured would better place ask subreddit professional patient clinical trial fda clearance medical device spinal condition cleared approved signed trial consent paperwork surgery date scheduled dec th device placed spine december th le day planning entire life around would major surgery find clinician team sponsor closed enrollment cancelled surgery absolutely devastated angry disappointed hopeless strongly believed device would life changing communication sponsor whatsoever trial page still list recruiting also reached sponsor facebook done month ago ask information trial received prompt response time read message since responded question common practice chance mistake expect communication sponsor would advise situation,sadness
"Yes, this can happen in medical device trials. 

In these studies, while you have consented and been approved (or determined eligible by the Investigator - not sure if the sponsor has an independent screening committee that approves pts), you are usually not considered ENROLLED until the device enters your body. 

The protocol will only allow a max number of enrolled patients. Unless this was unexpected study closure due to major safety issues with the device, your physician/site staff should have been notified in advance that enrollment was nearing the max (and were likely told to stop consenting patients by the Sponsor for this reason). They should have also told you that the study was nearing enrollment completion and there was a possibility you wouldn’t make the cut. 

This sounds like a case of bad communication, either by the site to you, the sponsor to the site, or even possibly the site to the sponsor (if a site doesn’t enter their data in a timely manner, it’s possible that the sponsor doesn’t even know you were consented).

I’m sorry this happened to you. It is indeed a punch in the gut when you are not told that this is a possibility. 

The sponsor has to report enrollment updates to clinicaltrials.gov within 30 days of enrollment closing, but these updates may take a week or two to implement. Would be interesting to see if the entire study closed enrollment or just the site you were at (as sites are also only allowed a certain maximum of enrollments to ensure that they aren’t enrolling a statistically significant number of patients over all other sites).

What I would do if I were you: confirm with the research coordinator/ Investigator if they were notified by the sponsor previously that enrollment closure was near and if they knew this was a possibility, why the enrollment closed (met protocol max, device not safe, sponsor lost funding, etc) and if applicable, if the study is closed across all study sites or just at their site.",59,yes happen medical device trial study consented approved determined eligible investigator sure sponsor independent screening committee approves pt usually considered enrolled device enters body protocol allow max number enrolled patient unless unexpected study closure due major safety issue device physician site staff notified advance enrollment nearing max likely told stop consenting patient sponsor reason also told study nearing enrollment completion possibility make cut sound like case bad communication either site sponsor site even possibly site sponsor site enter data timely manner possible sponsor even know consented sorry happened indeed punch gut told possibility sponsor report enrollment update clinicaltrials gov within day enrollment closing update may take week two implement would interesting see entire study closed enrollment site site also allowed certain maximum enrollment ensure enrolling statistically significant number patient site would confirm research coordinator investigator notified sponsor previously enrollment closure near knew possibility enrollment closed met protocol max device safe sponsor lost funding etc applicable study closed across study site site,anger
"That sounds extremely frustrating, I’m sorry this has happened to you. To answer your question, generally the sponsor cannot communicate directly with trial participants other than referring them to the closest sites conducting the trial. If I were you I would call the research coordinator at the study site and ask them what’s going on. My guess is that this was an unexpected halt to the trial and not something foreseeable such as reaching the enrollment ceiling. In that sense it may be a blessing in disguise that you were not able to proceed with this specific surgery. Best of luck and I hope you’re able to find a different procedure that can help with your condition.",16,sound extremely frustrating sorry happened answer question generally sponsor communicate directly trial participant referring closest site conducting trial would call research coordinator study site ask going guess unexpected halt trial something foreseeable reaching enrollment ceiling sense may blessing disguise able proceed specific surgery best luck hope able find different procedure help condition,anger
"There's a number of reasons why enrollment has been closed and not every reason is going to be publicly disclosed. Your best bet is to contact your coordinator for additional information or wait a few weeks and check clinicaltrials.gov to see if enrollment has ended for your site only or across the entire study. 

Every site is usually delegated x amount of subjects to screen and enroll, with the expectation that a certain percentage of them will screen fail. Your site may have hit that number already.

To get the study completed as quickly as possible, sometimes the sponsor may implement competitive enrollment where all sites continously enroll until a set amount of subjects across the study have successfully completed surgery.

There is also unfortunately a chance that in the period between your screening visit and surgery date, an unexpected device adverse event was discovered that may jeopardize the safety and wellbeing of subjects. If that were the case, the sponsor absolutely must do everything to investigate and decide if they must close enrollment immediately. 


If you ask the coordinator and/or note that enrollment is continuing you can try to request enrollment at another nearby site.",8,number reason enrollment closed every reason going publicly disclosed best bet contact coordinator additional information wait week check clinicaltrials gov see enrollment ended site across entire study every site usually delegated x amount subject screen enroll expectation certain percentage screen fail site may hit number already get study completed quickly possible sometimes sponsor may implement competitive enrollment site continously enroll set amount subject across study successfully completed surgery also unfortunately chance period screening visit surgery date unexpected device adverse event discovered may jeopardize safety wellbeing subject case sponsor absolutely must everything investigate decide must close enrollment immediately ask coordinator note enrollment continuing try request enrollment another nearby site,sadness
"so sorry to hear this. :( unfortunately it does happen...to be honest, if the sponsor was this close to reaching their target of randomized pts, I'm surprised your team at the site didn't warn you that this was a possibility. There could have also been a safety issue that paused enrolment earlier than expected in which case there was no way this could have been foreseen.

"I have worked at a clinical research site for over twenty years and have seen this happen many, many times. Sometimes the sponsor closes enrollment because they have reached their global patient cap, and some sponsors are better than others at communicating that to sites beforehand. It's also possible that the study was put on hold or ended prematurely for safety reasons.

I can think of other situations that could cause this to happen, although these probably don't apply to you- sometimes when a site reaches their screen fail ratio cap, and will no longer be paid for patients who don't make enrollment, they decide to stop enrolling. Sometimes internal things occur, like a key coordinator quits, or the hospital changes their procedure fees.

I understand your frustration and I'm sorry that you were excluded from this at the last minute, but you might be better off for it in the long run. It is disappointing but unfortunately it happens and there's not much that can be done.

"FYI in Pharma (not sure but probably also applies to device sponsors too), there is almost no staff in office in the US (and many other countries) between Christmas and New Years.  Also, many people leave the week before Christmas trying to burn up their vacation time before the end of the year.  So the wait could be frustrating, but it may not because they are trying to avoid contact.  

Additionally, check on clinicaltrials.gov if this is a US trial to see if the study is still open.  (You may have to use the Advanced Search to find the study you were in.) If the study is still open and you should be able to find a listing of other doctors (Investigators) participating in the trial.  Reach out to them (if in your area) and find out if you can join.  Because you have already been in the study, you may not be able to join again, but a different doctor's office (site) can help answer those questions.  

If the whole study was stopped for cause, then be glad.  That means the device may not have been doing what it was supposed to or was causing bad effects for people who had already had it implanted. 

If it was stopped because they met their enrollment numbers,  then there is a possibility that this device may be on the market soon enough.

It's a 2-way conversation as you are also getting your opinion of this recruiter (see below). 

You have significant Clinical Research experience at the site, with academic qualification too. This puts you in a good position. The relationship between recruiters and applicants changes over time. As a noob they are very much in control but once you get a few years under your belt (as you have done) the tables are turned somewhat. 

Many recruiters just want to get an ""ass on a seat"" so that that can get their 20-30% or whatever their finders fee is. Organizations with any sense will stipulate that their referral should stay for X months otherwise there should be a claw back. Thus the recruiter should make their best effort to determine if you're the best fit and will likely stay the course.

IMO the best approach is just to jot down what you have done and achieved over the years. Have a few metrics on study numbers, etc., and examples on how you overcame difficult people/situations. 

Be friendly, courteous and don't downplay anything. Treat it as a learning exercise and be yourself. You may be lucky and end up with a recruiter that actually looks out for you over a few years.

"Hi all, I recently received a promotion from Research Associate to CTM on a longitudinal NIDA funded study about disclosing recovery from a substance use disorder (SUD). For the pilot and other phases of the study, we only recruited about 300 people and managed the study primarily using qualtrics for data entry and storage and Google Drive for calendars, schedules, and retention practices. However, with this new big kid grant, we're looking to recruit a MUCH larger pool of participants across multiple sites making google pretty null and void. Cha gurls in a little over her head here !

So, we're looking into purchasing clinical trials management software. However, we do not need a lot of the tools offered in these packages (bio specimens protocols etc) and simply need something that will allow us to keep track of participants status in the program over 3 years. I've poked around this sub already and have been hearing good things about Jeeva. Does anyone have experience with this? 

It should also be noted that I will be having undergrads-grads help with the collection of the data and they'll be conducting the intervention. So, I'm looking for something really user friendly (not a huge learning curve) that can help keep track of participant status, scheduling, and reminders about when to text reminders for appointments etc. Does anyone know of any software like this? Or it might be better to ask- do any of you who do research heavy on qualitative collection have any programs you'd recommend? The program doesn't have to do anything related to data analysis, just managing the tracking, recruitment and retention for the study.

"Anyone with experience as a sponsor CTM - I would appreciate it SO MUCH if you could provide some advice.

I have been working with a very small sponsor company developing a strong drug candidate in rare disease. We have no approved/commercialized product yet. I started as a CTA and was promoted to Sr. CTA after 1 year. After 1 year as Sr. CTA I have been assuming the role of lead CTM on a study under the supervision of a highly experienced Sr. CTM for about 6 months, but my title was still Sr. CTA.

I recently learned that my promotion to CTM has been approved (hooray!!). However the compensation offer (107k) is a lot lower than what should be expected for a sponsor CTM based on the salary spreadsheet in this sub. I haven't negotiated yet but definitely plan to do so.

The thing is, I do want to stay with the company if possible, because I love the team that I work with (experienced, capable and intelligent group with strong support from manager/department head), I have good work/life balance, am able to work fully remote, and my development has been fast. That being said, I don't want to sell myself short on comp if there are better opportunities elsewhere.

**What would you do if you were in my position? Take the promotion and leave after some time (6 months to a year)?**

"I participated in a clinical trial at ICON last month for this IM injection medication used to treat psoriasis. I was only injected with one dose so I didn’t think I would experience any major side effects. I only experienced minor side effects such as small rashes that would break out on my body. I stayed in the facility for a week and by the time I was released, I thought I wasn’t experiencing anymore side effects. Well fast forward 2 weeks, I started taking a science course at my college and I have been STRUGGLING to focus or retain any information at all. Even when I am in class listening to the Professor lecture, I can not focus and retain any of the information the Professor lectures about. If I could describe how I feel, I would say it feels like extreme brain fog. For context, (it is not my intention to sound cocky) I recently graduated and received my bachelors degree with a straight 4.0 GPA. I tried convincing myself that maybe it was my studying method, but I knew I was lying to self by trying to blame my lack of focus on that. I know how to effectively study and what works best for me. I have had to resort to drinking coffee, (which I very rarely drink), just so I can hold focus. This lack of focus is extremely alarming for me since I have always been a straight A student and have never struggled to retain information. I will be attending a graduate program next year, and not being able to focus or retain information would substantially impact me and my future endeavors. This was my first clinical trial that I participated in and since the money was a good amount, I figured I could put it towards my tuition.  Now I’m seriously stressing that I won’t be able to focus or retain information like I once could. Has anyone else received this study medication and experienced this side effect? It’s only been a little over a month since I was discharged, but would this side effect fade away once the medication is fully washed out of my body or could this possibly be long term? The NP told me that it takes 3 months for this medication to wash out of the body. I also looked on the consent form they gave me and brain fog was not listed as a possible side effect. I’ll be going to my next outpatient visit next week and I plan on bringing this to the staffs attention so I can get some advice. 
I would greatly appreciate any and all feedback that anyone has to give. 

PSA: this is my first time making a post on Reddit and I’m still trying to figure out how to navigate it.

"In my experience (important to note, as others may have different experience), site clinical research managers tend to manage the resourcing of multiple CRCs across multiple studies and even across multiple departments/indications. They are kind of like the HUCs (health unit coordinators) of research at larger institutions. Just like HUCs don't really do traditional nursing duties, research managers aren't usually that involved with the actual day-to-day execution of the protocol, but help coordinate CRCs as needed. And as others have said, CTM is more of a sponsor/CRO role designation and indicates sponsor-level national or global trial management, so that wouldn't really be appropriate. 

Based off your job description duties, it sounds to me like you're doing standard CRC work. However, if they are agreeable to a title change, why not? Honestly, from a CRO/Sponsor perspective, I would be more impressed with a Senior CRC job title than that of a research manager, because I'd rather have someone with recent experience of day-to-day execution of a study than someone who has spent the last few years doing more admin/resourcing work.

"The US allows foreign nationals to obtain an individual taxpayer identification number, or ITIN. For non-nationals, it is, for all intents and purposes, a rough equivalent to a US Social Security Number. You will not be eligible for US Social Security benefits. In the US, citizens use their Social Security Numbers as de facto tax ID numbers. Since you’re a non-citizen, there is a workaround allowed by the US-Canada Income Tax Convention (treaty). This is to prevent double taxation.

Follow the process at: https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/taxpayer-identification-numbers-tin

You will need to complete and mail the Form W-7 to the US IRS. You will need to put your Canadian SIN in box 6b. 

I *believe* your reason selection would be Box A. You are from Canada, and the associated tax treaty section which you would be claiming benefits is XIV, independent personal services. You will need this so you do not get double taxed on the income. 

I am not a US tax attorney but this is generally the process. You can find more information online or by reaching out to an approved US tax attorney.

Please keep in mind that crossing the border into the states as a Canadian is a complete different process from obtaining a US tax ID number and while most Canadians do not require a visa for up to a six month stay in the US, the border agent had ultimate authority to exclude you if they suspect that you are here to perform work for which a visa is usually required, and they’re fully within their rights to do so. 

I’ve seen a few subjects kicked out by USCIS because of dodgy incomplete paperwork, poor comprehension and explanation of what they’re doing here, and we’ve had to send letters of invitation to our partners to make everyone happy. So just be vigilant. You’re not doing anything dodgy, but the border agents tend to be very twitchy people.

When you DO get your ITIN, you provide it on a form W-8BEN to the requestor (clinical trial site). An American national doing the same process would provide their SSN on form W-9. Note: We do NOT provide our actual Social Security Number card to *anyone* for review. It’s simply a signed document that we certify under penalty of perjury.",3,u allows foreign national obtain individual taxpayer identification number itin non national intent purpose rough equivalent u social security number eligible u social security benefit u citizen use social security number de facto tax id number since non citizen workaround allowed u canada income tax convention treaty prevent double taxation follow process need complete mail form w u irs need put canadian sin box b believe reason selection would box canada associated tax treaty section would claiming benefit xiv independent personal service need get double taxed income u tax attorney generally process find information online reaching approved u tax attorney please keep mind crossing border state canadian complete different process obtaining u tax id number canadian require visa six month stay u border agent ultimate authority exclude suspect perform work visa usually required fully within right seen subject kicked uscis dodgy incomplete paperwork poor comprehension explanation send letter invitation partner make everyone happy vigilant anything dodgy border agent tend twitchy people get itin provide form w ben requestor clinical trial site american national process would provide ssn form w note provide actual social security number card anyone review simply signed document certify penalty perjury,joy

"It's will be helpful to understand a few of the workings and reasons behind the site.

1. [CT.gov](https://CT.gov) is a database where applicable trials are registered for the purpose of:
   1. Creating a free, publicly available, searchable database of trials
   2. Creating a searchable database of trial results
2. Potential uses of the site are many and include:
   1. Reducing bias in research by requiring registration of trials regardless of results
   2. Requiring results to be posted regardless of negative outcomes
   3. A tool for the public to find enrolling trials they may be interested / eligible for

With that in mind, a key consideration with trial registrations is the responsible party. This is the person or organization required for posting the trial. They may keep the responsibility, or delegate it to someone else (i.e. Pharma to CRO, PI to Regulatory Support). It may be Pharma/Biotech, Federal org, Non-profit, Academic Center, Individual PI. 

[CT.gov](https://CT.gov) has required fields and data to be entered. HOW that data are entered has wide variability. Pharma/Biotech in many cases don't list specific site information in favor (IMO) of directing all potential participants to a contact number they own, enabling their collection of that data. Other responsible parties, like a PI, will include explicit info for how to contact a study team member at their site, or participating sites, to potentially aid in enrollment. 

Additionally, believing information is accurate and up-to-date on any posting is unlikely. The resources to maintain postings just isn't reliable. Which is why you'll see so many registrations out of compliance, i.e. registrations not posting results by required date. 

So long story short, there is no standard best practice for transparency with site information. And the site information there is likely incomplete, intentionally opaque, and/or unreliable.",3,helpful understand working reason behind site ct gov database applicable trial registered purpose creating free publicly available searchable database trial creating searchable database trial result potential us site many include reducing bias research requiring registration trial regardless result requiring result posted regardless negative outcome tool public find enrolling trial may interested eligible mind key consideration trial registration responsible party person organization required posting trial may keep responsibility delegate someone else e pharma cro pi regulatory support may pharma biotech federal org non profit academic center individual pi ct gov required field data entered data entered wide variability pharma biotech many case list specific site information favor imo directing potential participant contact number enabling collection data responsible party like pi include explicit info contact study team member site participating site potentially aid enrollment additionally believing information accurate date posting unlikely resource maintain posting reliable see many registration compliance e registration posting result required date long story short standard best practice transparency site information site information likely incomplete intentionally opaque unreliable,joy

"Both regions follow GCP guidelines so you are governed by basically the same ¨rules¨ from a monitoring perspective. I do find PIs to be pretty absent at least in some TA in the US compared to other countries in the World (but I guess this also varies a lot within the EU itself), so it might be a bit more challenging to ensure PI oversight in some cases and larger institutions.

Staff-wise, you do see a lot of study coordinators (especially If they are nurses) doing a lot of procedures that elsewhere would only be done by physicians. It is extremely common for nurse SCs to take consent and participate very actively in the process, process laboratory samples sometimes. Of course it all depends on the site, but in other regions an SC taking consent is a no-go and against regulations. 

Also, in the US compared to EU (but also other regions such as Latam and APAC) you might have less regulatory barriers to activate a site, with the exception of some universities and larger institutions which might have further regulatory instances. In some European countries you need National approval, EC approval (sometimes more than 1 EC for a single site), radiation committees, etc etc etc so it gets more complex compared to the standard site in the US.

In the US HIPAA is a standard regarding patient data ([**https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/hipaa.html**](https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/hipaa.html)) and you should be familiar with it, and I understand some states might have further regulations such as California, although I have not worked with Cali for some time now.

EU sites... man, the amount you have to provide and the amount of bodies you need approval from, it's like managing a mini study at every site sometimes! Haha. 


But seriously, your biggest adjustment will be in attitudes and roles of site staff. As another commenter mentioned, different roles function very differently in the US vs EU. Some PIs are borderline absent in trials and it's normalized (sadly); compared to the vast majority of EU sites where I've sometimes seen PIs themselves submit things to EC!

"I'm a medical writer and have written many clinical trial protocols and synopses/outlines throughout the years. Trial design is a cross-functional effort that combines the science, feasibility and ethical/regulatory compliance, so there is no single person responsible for it.

Depending on the type of study you may have other experts involved (eg. clinpharm, HTA). We may even have patient representatives involved to solidify the study feasibility. The final design comes from everyone's input, and putting everything together is quite challenging.

Depending on the sponsor and team, before the protocol there can be an outline/synopsis stage where we solidify the scientific aspects, objectives, rationale, population, SoA, etc before moving to the full protocol.

"I've been on the job hunt for six months since being laid off by my former company in October 2023. My official title was Data Acquisition Associate (Data Entry) and I performed entry on ECGs, Cardiopulmonary Exercise Tests, Holter Monitor Recordings and GI Recordings sent to us from Global Clinical Test sites received via post, email, file share and company site upload tool. I also tended to take charge of the high volume retrospective studies by preparing them and performing entry and/or sharing prepared images with colleagues so they may assist with initial entry. This data was then analyzed by our Cardiac Safety team.

I would love to stay within the Clinical Trial field, but I know I am not experienced enough to step up to CRA level. Personally, I'd rather continue doing what I was doing, perhaps from the Clinical site side rather than the vendor side, but I'm not sure if that type of job exists. I'm also not sure if there are other vendors out there as my former company seems to be buying them all.

I try to highlight how I went from inexperienced receptionist  to associate entrusted with training new hires and providing cross training for existing team members in under two years.

"Hey everyone, I'm currently working at a biotech as a CTM on med device trials. As a side project, my team is also helping our applied research and product teams to combine their research protocols into one IRB protocol. They do the sort of ""R&D"" research for our devices - testing everything from usability of the device and user satisfaction, to evaluating technical issues with the device, to outcomes (but not using clinical outcome measures). The device is class II, non-interventional. So, it's not quite clinical research, but definitely human subjects research. 

Does anyone have any experience or guidance they can share on what should be included in this sort of ""umbrella"" protocol? I was thinking a broad protocol document with broad goals and eligibility, and then for each specific study that the team wants to run, submit a one-page document detailing the extra I/E criteria and study procedures. Is this reasonable? There would be associated ICFs - larger one(s), and then consent ""addendums"" or info sheets for the specifics. We have many people who participate in multiple of these studies and the teams want to make it easy for these participants and not have them have to complete a 15-page ICF for each of the 10 studies they want to participate in. It's possible some of these ""sub-studies"" may even qualify for a waiver of consent but I have to dig more into that.

Any thoughts/reactions are welcome! This is new territory for me and I wanted a gut-check on whether this sort of thing is doable.",3,hey everyone currently working biotech ctm med device trial side project team also helping applied research product team combine research protocol one irb protocol sort r research device testing everything usability device user satisfaction evaluating technical issue device outcome using clinical outcome measure device class ii non interventional quite clinical research definitely human subject research anyone experience guidance share included sort umbrella protocol thinking broad protocol document broad goal eligibility specific study team want run submit one page document detailing extra e criterion study procedure reasonable would associated icfs larger one consent addendum info sheet specific many people participate multiple study team want make easy participant complete page icf study want participate possible sub study may even qualify waiver consent dig thought reaction welcome new territory wanted gut check whether sort thing doable,joy
"I am not an expert, but have experience on some umbrella trials and 1 basket trial, but only clinical trials and with pharmaceuticals (my med device knowledge is very rudimentary), and from a long time ago, so please excuse if I'm saying anything nonsensical or outdated.

I usually see umbrella studies as those assessing multiple interventions in a single population and basket as a single intervention in multiple populations (again, I'm in pharma clinical trial land here), so please check if umbrella is the correct term to be used. This is nitpicky stuff, it's just to avoid any queries down the road.

Regardless, I think your approach overall makes sense. Definitely create a master protocol that includes the bulk of the study, and you can include either as appendices or as separate documents, the specific info for each substudy. Some tips I would like to give:

\- I usually favor the use of separate documents for each substudy. If we need to amend one of the substudies, we can in theory amend that document and leave the others alone, assuming there is no repeated information between documents (please check with regulatory expert if this can be done, though, it may depend on how the studies will be coded/registered).

\- If you haven't already, before diving in the protocol create an outline with the study design (objectives, endpoints, design, SoA, population, statistical considerations) and exactly what should be specific to each substudy. This should be aligned with all major stakeholders (ie, the people who will run, manage, analyse, etc the study). Master/subprotocols can be a massive can of worms, so you should be as prepared as possible before writing the actual protocol. The study design should be discussed and closed before, otherwise it will be a lot more difficult to manage.

\- Avoid repeating information in the subprotocols as much as possible. Cross-reference as much as you can. If you repeat stuff, any amendment will be an absolute nightmare. I/E is a good example, you can just put in the master protocol the criteria applicable to all participants and then say ""see subprotocols for specific criteria"". One possible exception to this may be the SoA. If it gets too complicated to separate in 2 tables, making it too difficult for the site staff to follow, I guess you can repeat the master schedule in each subprotocol and then include the specific assessments to each substudy. But if possible, I would still have the master assessments in the master protocol only. Check with PI/clinical staff if possible what is best for the people in the field.

\-  I'm not sure if you meant in your post that the study itself would be non-interventional, or if the device was non-invasive. If this is a non-interventional study, I recommend avoiding as much as possible any procedures that can be interpreted as distortions to the ""routine"" clinical practice. This is extremely subjective, so having the PI/CI participating in the process will avoid problems down the road with regulatory or site staff interpreting this study as being interventional. Ignore this whole bullet if you are doing an interventional study and I misunderstood your post.

\- Please check if it is ok to have the same participant in multiple studies and how to work on the ICFs. There can be operational, regulatory, or scientific concerns, so check with subject matter experts if you can. For example, if 1 person can be included in multiple studies, will they have the same participant ID? Will it be different? Will each substudy be analyzed 100% independently or will there be statistical analysis pulling all substudies together? If the latter, having 1 person in multiple substudies can be an issue. Those details must be ironed out.

Good luck!

"Varying levels of feasibility at sites - this is from a sponsor perspective. From site-level, this means various levels of training, familiarity with systems. Differing levels of compliance.

 In terms of consent, the processes can be different at least in the US across states. It can be different, I'm sure, in the EU. You also have to think about the delivery of clinical supply to sites.

Different sites usually means different IRBs.

 Is the investigational product needing some sort of temperature regulation, and will you need to check for excursions on-site upon receipt of shipments? Different sites may have different procedures for storage and quarantine of drug. Again, alignment is important here.

With multi center you have to balance enrollment/ recruitment across sites. How do you manage this? This means monitoring closely what's going on and hopefully having a system to set up alerts for when enrollment is low and where it is approaching site limits.

How do you roll out communication for things like amendments across sites? What resources do you provide to assist sites with this?

How do you compile reports to communicate with the sponsor?

I think it's a valid concern however as long as you are upfront about it and rationale while you should be okay.

"It depends on the CRO and what background check vendor they are using.  Some background checks have their employment history verified by how you file your federal taxes (company name and position) instead of reaching out to your referrals/your company's HR (useful when you don't want them to tip off your current company or coworkers that you are shopping around).

Having a second job can be risky for future jobs, but it also might not be.  Depends on your next employer who might or might not care.  I know several Clinical Leads who would do temporary seasonal work at retailers, but it is only for like two months out of the year and at least one of them has been able to CRO hop afterwards without any problems. The argument is that these are temp side gigs that can be dropped at any time there is an urgent need from the study like database lock.

Alternatively, any future company might frown upon it and argue that you are not dedicated enough to get the job done, as you might need to hang around to review and approve reports up till midnight EST or whenever the deadline is, considering time zones and how the CRAs under you are traveling.  You can't argue that the deliverables were not met because you had to report to your other job.

If you are not being compensated properly, the better solution might be to shop around, get better offers, and then present to your current company for a counter offer to stay.

I am also considering moving into project management for my next role, and then back into clinical operations as a CTM. Has anyone taken this career path and had success?

Its a dermal filler called Evolysse being developed by a US company called Evolus.  They're partnered with a french company called Symatese, who allegedly developed a proprietary crosslinking technology that is different from ones currently available.

There are actually kind of a lot of details on it besides the trials themselves:

At their earnings call yesterday, they said they are running two versions of the product in a 140 person trial across 6 trial sites over the course of a year and that it will end in Q4 of this year, which is coming up.

They have a 3rd trial for a 3rd version of the product (versions are just injected in different places) with 308 patients across 11 sites.  They said its 2 years in duration and results are expected in 2025.  They spoke as though it has already started.

They're comparing against Restylane-Lyft (an already approved product) and utilizing a ""validated nasal waveform scale""

We know the technology is ""cold crosslinked hyaluronic acid"".

Dermal fillers are considered medical devices, so that may be part of the workaround?  Or the fact that it isn't studying a product already regulated by the FDA?  I feel like there is enough information, I've tried enough keywords, and scrolled through enough trials on enough different databases around the world over the past 3 months that I should've seen something that matches by now.

When I had reached out to the IR person at the company they said ""not available because it is being run by a CRO"".  I'm inclined at this point to believe it isn't available, but not sure why the CRO matters.

Its part of my job to search clinical trial databases and be generally familiar with stuff like this.

"Hmm when looking for Symatese as Other terms, there are two dermal filler studies that come up, but those don't fit your description.
 The Restylane-Lyft as comparator shows up in some trials but also none that fit your description. 

As you said, the CRO shouldn't matter for registries... unless the company mistakenly believes that the CRO is then responsible for registration? If they don't have too much experience, this might just have slipped through the cracks perhaps. 

Or there is some criterion that they meet that makes this not mandatory to register. Medical device is not exempt, but phase 1 is.

"I was curious and googled clinical trial management and university to see what you were talking about.

Honestly it sounds like a potentially expensive certification that prepares individuals to be competitive as a Clinical research coordinator. 

There are site managers (pm, operations). But my experience is individuals in those roles were crcs and either went to another institution or are eventually promoted.

Note: without experience it can be quite challenging.

 From source creation to regulatory to data entry/management which id say is The foundation. staffing whether longer term or project specific or short term, meetings with dept heads staff different fx groups. Work flow in general.

Vendor management and/or ensuring supplies equipment and documentation are up to snuff. Investigational pharmacy liasoning or being a pharmacy. 

Compliant monitoring plans (data, clinical OPs, QA). Remaining compliant with monitoring plans. Ensuring dmsb other applicable plans in place/followed including requirements outlined in contacts.

Ensuring staff are compliant with trainings, processes, sops. Documenting/maintains records. SOP creation. Ensuring PI or appropriate authority (if for a local policy/procedure to work at an institution). 

Then the finances. Contracts, budgets/reconciliation, tracking invoices, forecasting, ensuring budget is used at right time to avoid losing it or hurting project later on. Grant reporting. Finance reports. 

All above lists. In addition to being compliant/ethical/following good practices...also to ensure audits when they happen go well. Audits can be internal/local, sponsor/delegate, government, funding or finance group.

While some or much of this might just be ensuring correct liason/group gets materials. E.g. contracts/grants handling cda and contract negotiations. Some is taken care of at site level most of the time like e.g. required vendor lists, supplies through cro (just ordering supplies). 

Non site is truly dependent on experience whether Clinical trial manager(CTM) at a CRO or ctm/clinical trial associate (titles can vary across the industry). Clinical trial managers or equivalent within industry... there is no way to obtain a degree and not have appropriate experience to be qualified to do the job.

"Hello, I'm a pharmacist from Spain who decided to start a master's degree in Clinical Trials Monitoring which I'm about to end in March, also I have entered an internship as a CRC in a hospital (Feb - Jun) but I find pretty difficult to find a CRA position. 

I expect to develop the right skills while the internship, I really want to work as a CRA in the future. Everyday I see plenty of job offers on Linkedin but I get rejected on all of them while other people with the same education as me get the job (most of them nurses).

Is it really that difficult to get a job as a CRA? A few friends told me it's very easy once you're inside the industry field, but I find very difficult to enter. 

I'm just about to start my internship and the hospital will let me try everything I want. What do you think are the skills I must acquire as an intern to maximise the oportunities later to get a job?

Also which course do you think I should take to improve my CV? I have done a pharmacovigilance course, ICH and Handling for transportation of dangerous goods. Also I'm doing a Medical Affairs course. I'm not sure if a course on Data Entry or Data Analyst would be right for me. What would you do?

"Hmmm. I'd love to see the original reference for this statement:

>*"" One out of five trials will fail based on the inability to recruit and retain patients. ""*

... and also confirmation that this pertains to trials of new products pre-registration rather than an overall numbers of all the trials on clinicaltrials.gov.

In my experience many trials ""fail"" because they don't meet clinical significance. Which technically isn't a ""fail"" since every trial is an experiment so even a therapeutic fail means the trial was a scientific success - just not the outcome we wanted!

The final 2 paragraphs are the most important, IMHO:

>*But there are some drawbacks to decentralized trials, as well.*  
>  
>*“There is better oversight in a centralized sort of study: medication distribution, data security, patient safety must also be a consideration. Centralized clinical trials provide better oversight. But it’s a balance. It’s a balance between speed, efficiency, real world versus better oversight of the data that is collected,” he said. “But as we enter the era of better connectivity, those obstacles, I think, will become easier to overcome.”*

"Oh dear. The Sponsor cannot cherry pick who goes into the study. 

The Sponsor set the eligibility criteria however they want in the protocol, and it is against these that the PI measures suitability. These are approved by IEC/IRB and are a binary condition - either a Subject meets them or they don't. 

If the Subjects consents to participate and meets all the INEX criteria (including the usual one about the PI thinks they're suitable) and there's still a slot available in the Study then they should be in. 

If the Sponsor interferes with this Subject Selection process then they are in for a big surprise come submission and inspection time. 

Note (before I am flamed): I have seen many Sponsors use ""eligibility confirmation"" forms which allow Medical Monitors to advise PI and provide clarification on complex, nuanced eligibility criteria but they cannot cherry pick ""better Subjects."" 

EMA looks very unfavorably on Sponsors acting as final arbiters by ""approving"" Subject entry into a study. In a few cases where I have seen this they requested to see every single signed form and an explanation of why each subject was excluded. 

As a start I would reference ICH E6(R2) 4.3.1.  ""A qualified physician (or dentist, when appropriate), **who is an investigator or a sub-investigator for the trial**, should be **responsible for all trial-related medical (or dental) decisions**."" - that includes being enrolled into the study.

"Did the patient already consent? If so and they meet criteria I would say they have to let you continue to enroll unless there is a significant safety concern.

Is the study is assigning slots for enrollment? If that’s the case then I would say yes they can but “better” is the wrong word. Typically when studies have enrollment restricted by slot assignment those slots are given based on patient need so it’s possible your patient was not granted a slot in favor of another patient who has a more critical need from another site.",2,patient already consent meet criterion would say let continue enroll unless significant safety concern could understand asking hold patient lab value showing trend direction exclusionary even redraw confirm denying together study assigning slot enrollment case would say yes better wrong word typically study enrollment restricted slot assignment slot given based patient need possible patient granted slot favor another patient critical need another site,fear

"San Francisco State University's Extended Learning Program used to have the Clinical Trials Design and Management Program. It was about $5000-$7000 out of pocket for all the courses needed to complete the program, including some electives. It took over a year of evening and some weekends classes to complete while still working a day job. This was around 2015-2016 I think.

The information is very high level, but it did not guarantee me a job. I was fortunate to have met a staffing recruiter that eventually got me into a Clinical Trials Associate job. After working as a CTA in a few places, it became apparent that its the experience and connections that matter more in this industry. What I learned in the program was too high level and I was never going to get so high up in one pathway to apply what I learned in the real world.

You just need to get your foot in the door and do the work to prove yourself to your superiors. Unfortunately, starting salaries in Clin Ops are not great. When you compare to software engineers and also live in the SF Bay Area, you are already behind financially. You have to get to at least a manager or senior manager level to earn a ""comfortable"" living, and that takes several years to get there.

Also when you start off as a contractor (because this industry hires a lot of them), you likely won't get benefits such as stock grants until you get hired full time. But even if hired as an FTE, what good are those stocks if they don't perform?

I can go more in depth, but I will save that for another post or a dm if you so wish. Lastly, I will say that unless you get to work on study start up, maintenance, and close out on many clinical trial studies at a good frequency, you won't really get a great grasp at how things ideally should be done (because every company does things slightly differently, per their SOPs) and the clinical trials take a long time from start to finish (unlike something like accounting where you generally would perform the same things every month or every quarter). Take good notes, keep a log, save emails and document everything you have done, and keep track of your progress every step of the way, because you will need them sometime down the road.

I would say it really isn't necessary to take these courses because you can learn about what each department does when you get into a company. You don't need to know everything your colleagues do down to the details, but just enough on the things that impact you/your department. Save your money and gain experience by working in one of these fields.

*y = intercept + treatment + centre + error*

With centre as fixed effect if there is a little number of hospitals (< 5) or random effect if there is a high number and if we want to project the conclusions onto the wider population that the hospitals were sampled from.

I have read in some books that the patient should be added as random factor in statistical analysis to account for the inherent variability in patient responses.

"I personally think this would be a great opportunity and a valid stepping stone into the clinical research world. You could make a case for yourself on your experience to talk about how you know how to thoroughly review and understand the protocol and how that translates to site recruitment. As a CRA, you will need to understand site processes and how feasible the site is for recruitment (evaluate their physical location, equipment/facilities, what is their patient population, what is their strategy for identifying subjects, how they run things, and is it all actually a good plan that will work for the site? What are the barriers you foresee to recruitment for the site, how will this be handled, are they really able to meet the goals of the trial that the sponsor has? Do they have competing trials, etc). Another skill you’d get from this is working with sites, communities, and getting an understanding of how sites work and what research is about. By serving as a resource to sites, you’d also be gaining training skills and identifying issues that could pop up and help prevent them. That is a big part of the role of a CRA. But the biggest perk of this role would be the professional connections you’d make and the relationship management with the sites. That’s 100% how I got my first clinical research job. I had zero experience in the field (I have a master’s in education administration) but because a PI I volunteered with gave me a chance, I was able to progress from CRC, to CRA, to central monitor at a CRO and I work from home everyday. You’ll get to make a lot of connections doing outreach. You can also learn more about regulatory and QA work. There are roles in research where someone’s job is to coach sites on recruitment strategies but I am not as familiar with those and how they work.

Best of luck!",2,personally think would great opportunity valid stepping stone clinical research world could make case experience talk know thoroughly review understand protocol translates site recruitment cra need understand site process feasible site recruitment evaluate physical location equipment facility patient population strategy identifying subject run thing actually good plan work site barrier foresee recruitment site handled really able meet goal trial sponsor competing trial etc another skill get working site community getting understanding site work research serving resource site also gaining training skill identifying issue could pop help prevent big part role cra biggest perk role would professional connection make relationship management site got first clinical research job zero experience field master education administration pi volunteered gave chance able progress crc cra central monitor cro work home everyday get make lot connection outreach also learn regulatory qa work role research someone job coach site recruitment strategy familiar work best luck,joy

"Former CTA, now CRA. I was a CTA for both a sponsor and a CRO (sponsor dedicated) for about 3 years so I kind of got the best of both worlds. In the clinical research world, you usually get people with either site experience or CTA experience. Both have their own benefits but I can say that through being a CTA, I definitely know essential documents/regulatory documents really well since I was responsible for the TMF and study start up + feasibility. That translates well into every clinical trial because the documents are largely universal.

Learn Outlook rules to sort emails by study, site, etc. Learn how to keep your notes and correspondences organized so that you can CYA if need be. These skills are 100% what future employers are looking for and the earlier you lay the foundation, the easier it'll be to maintain and employ. 
  
\-Get familiar with the essential documents - what things to look for, what is commonly overlooked, how each one correlates to another (DOA with licenses, credentials, CRF completion, 1572, etc). This is invaluable as a CRA! 
  
\-Never be afraid to ask questions! Other CTAs, mentors, CTMs, CRAs, LMs are invaluable wealth of knowledge. There's always going to be something that needs explanation, don't be afraid to ask! Sometimes, your questions are exactly what is needed to improve a process or make updates to SOPs and WI's. 
  
\-Be willing to offer help and form those interpersonal relationships with others. Knowing the right people and being a team player are such important qualities to have in this field. 
  
\-In your spare time, try to get as much experience with excel and the CTMS system as possible. Pivot tables, Vlookup, whatever there is in excel, LEARN IT. I've gotten job offers for jobs that I'm wholly unqualified for because of my familiarity with Excel. I've also been considered for roles simply because of the EDC and CTMS systems I've worked with and am comfortable using. That experience is what is translatable regardless of TA, indication, and direct monitoring experience (if you want to be a CRA down the line). 
  
\-Sometimes you'll feel like the bottom of the totem pole and that you're just providing administrative support. Just remember, we all started from somewhere. As any CRA and CTM will tell you, a good CTA is worth their weight in gold. When you're busy traveling and monitoring, things can get overlooked. If you have a good CTA on your side, it makes things so much easier. I've had to maintain the TMF and trackers on my own and had it not been my CTA experience, I would have definitely struggled.",13,former cta cra cta sponsor cro sponsor dedicated year kind got best world clinical research world usually get people either site experience cta experience benefit say cta definitely know essential document regulatory document really well since responsible tmf study start feasibility translates well every clinical trial document largely universal advice develop organization skill come handy line learn outlook rule sort email study site etc learn keep note correspondence organized cya need skill future employer looking earlier lay foundation easier maintain employ get familiar essential document thing look commonly overlooked one correlate another doa license credential crf completion etc invaluable cra never afraid ask question ctas mentor ctms cras lm invaluable wealth knowledge always going something need explanation afraid ask sometimes question exactly needed improve process make update sop wi willing offer help form interpersonal relationship others knowing right people team player important quality field spare time try get much experience excel ctms system possible pivot table vlookup whatever excel learn gotten job offer job wholly unqualified familiarity excel also considered role simply edc ctms system worked comfortable using experience translatable regardless ta indication direct monitoring experience want cra line sometimes feel like bottom totem pole providing administrative support remember started somewhere cra ctm tell good cta worth weight gold busy traveling monitoring thing get overlooked good cta side make thing much easier maintain tmf tracker cta experience would definitely struggled,joy

"Your current position is not clinical research manager, it's director. That amount of responsibility is huge! 

That said, going to a CTM position in a non-academia environment will be a step back in responsibility. You'll report to someone who oversees things like you are currently doing. 

There are remote CTM positions everywhere, from pharma to CRO to federal government. The hardest part about finding them is the fact that titles vary so much. But I will point out this: if you are in a client-facing role, then you will have to put in that much more effort to keep the client happy, even if their requests are unreasonable. If you are in a pharma or government role, you will be managing CROs and making requests (matrix management). 

I hope that helps, but please know that with a good employer and manager AND if you're working remotely, the work-life balance is great.

""Tell me about a time that you had to work with compliance"". 

Of course I did work with compliance but I cannot recall any interesting example related to compliance that could be developed into a structured answer (they require me to use the STAR method). I can only list some regulations or rules that were important to follow.

Are they asking if I've worked in Quality Assurance or with someone in QA? It's an odd question to begin with. 

Your written English is great! I posted this in another thread, but for the CTA role, the only thing that my CRO looks for in a candidate is a good attitude, reads/handles emails/tasks right away, files documents appropriately, willing to help out where needed, and follows up on items (responds back to confirm the items have been filed, or takes the initiative to put out friendly reminders to someone who is outstanding in a task).

**Clinical trials** are a type of research conducted to study new tests, treatments, and drugs and evaluate their outcomes, side effects, and efficacy on human health. There are various medical interventions, including drugs, biological products, radiological procedures, devices, behavioral treatments, surgical procedures, and preventive care in which people volunteer to take part[. Take Clinical Research Training for experience and on ground experience.](https://aaidenmenezee21.medium.com/whos-international-clinical-trials-registry-platform-ictrp-10b41839c0e6)

**Clinical trial phases**

Biomedical, clinical trials include the following four **clinical research phases**:

● Phase I of clinical trials usually studies new drugs for the first time in a small group of people to evaluate a safe dosage range and identify side effects.

● Phase II of clinical trials studies test treatments that were found safe in phase I of clinical trials. However, phase II is conducted on a larger group of human subjects for monitoring any adverse effects.

● Phase III of clinical trials is conducted in different regions and countries and on larger populations. Phase III is the step conducted right before a new treatment or drug is approved.

● Phase IV of clinical trials is conducted after a country approves, but there is still a need for further testing efficacy in a larger population over a longer timeframe.

[Learn Best Clinical Research Course for in depth knowledge.](https://www.clariwell.in/)

There are various guidelines outlined by different international and national organizations for ensuring careful design, review, and completion of the process. Clinical trials require approval before they can even begin. People of all ages, including children, can volunteer to participate in clinical trials. However, various guidelines direct the participation of people in clinical trials.

"The costs vary pretty greatly right, and there isn't really a definitive answer because there's huge amounts you can attribute to patient recruitment.

Every site chosen contributes to recruitment. Every bit of advertising contributes to recruitment. Every referral generated contributes to recruitment and so on.

Ultimately it's an acquisition cost, so you need to determine that for every patient ultimately randomised onto a trial, how many people have to be made aware about the existence of a trial and what's the hard cost (advertising, etc) as well as the FTE hours (recruitment vendor, site recruitment coordinator, CRO/sponsor trial oversight, etc).

I would not be surprised if for a rare enough indication with a strict enough in/ex criteria (say some sort of IBD trial with flare requirements), that it can cost $100k for every patient, and this is before people along the way make profits.

Google it, there's a paper in pub med (Estimated Costs of Pivotal Trials.......) from 2018 which is a good starting point.

Then go onto websites of some of the smaller recruitment vendors (MDGroup, Antidote.me, etc), they will all have blogs selling the need for recruitment services.

"I understand the sentiment of this post—I was a CRC at a very well known university research hospital who transitioned to the CRO world without being a monitor. Being a monitor was commonly touted as the only option for CRCs who wanted to leave the site side of clinical research.

I think it’s important that people know you don’t have to be a monitor to move away from the site side, no matter what the reason is (I am a terrible flyer so being required to fly multiple times per work for work would’ve probably caused me to change career fields). 

HUGE CAVEAT—if there are CRCs who want to move into different roles but can’t or won’t become a monitor, you need to be very strategic in your plans. As many have mentioned there will be many roles most CRCs won’t qualify for because they don’t have the training/prev work experience (CTL/CTM) or education requirements (MSL/Clinical Scientist/Medical Writer). You likely will have to apply to lots of different positions (make sure you have the qualifications) and really be able to tie your previous work experience into the roles and responsibilities of the role you’re applying for.

"Science-related degrees are beneficial, but more to help with your understanding than for job requirements. 

I'm surprised to keep reading that some companies hire CRCs so easily. My old company (California-based) hired people as a Research Assistant (RA) if they had no research experience or degree. However, if the person showed initiative and adapted well, they could get promoted to CRC a lot quicker. 

So, as others have said, I would advise getting the experience. You could start as an RA. They just get paid a lot less.

If you really want to try to get a CRC role first, I know from experience that CRCs have different responsibilities depending on the company. At one site, it could just mean you consent and schedule the participant; there will be a team of people to take care of everything else. It would be a lot easier to get such a position. Unfortunately, in the long run, it may not benefit you to be such a coordinator if you plan to advance. Those who were hired on as CRCs in my old company (because they claimed the title at a previous job) didn't last long within our company; the responsibilities and demands were too much for them.

"I was wondering if there are any guidelines about vaccine clinical trials.

"This is my purely anecdotal experience managing a few vaccine trials, one currently enrolling:

Efficacy data depends on a multitude of factors that I won’t even pretend to have a grasp on. It could be checking titers multiple times in the first 28 days and less regularly over a period of 6 to 12 months for COVID naive patients in a trial. In COVID+ patients, primary efficacy data might be endpoint driven (hospitalizations), since the overall aim is to prevent severe outcomes and death rather than prevent infection. On the other side, seasonal flu vaccines may only follow most subjects for SAEs and AEs, while checking a minor subset of subjects at day 28 for seroprotection because of a wealth of previous clinical trial data. Your mileage may vary depending on the ultimate goal of the product (prevention vs treatment, multiple trials previously vs first in human, etc). 

In terms of safety data, injection site reactions and anaphylaxis rear themselves in short order after dose administration. These can be showstoppers. Subject diaries for AEs and AEs of special interest are common for at least the first 7, sometimes through the first 28 days. Most safety follow up ends around month 6, in some cases month 12. And even then, that’s only patient reported AEs/SAEs at sporadic contact points through the final visit. Safety labs are not usually required throughout the study unless clinically indicated. 

Vaccine trials don’t have any special guidelines. Like any other study, if the protocol doesn’t meet the scientific and safety bar the FDA/EMA/whoever believes it needs to clear (including capture of “long-term effects” - not entirely sure what that entails), they’ll punt it back to the sponsor until it does.",2,purely anecdotal experience managing vaccine trial one currently enrolling efficacy data depends multitude factor even pretend grasp could checking titer multiple time first day le regularly period month covid naive patient trial covid patient primary efficacy data might endpoint driven hospitalization since overall aim prevent severe outcome death rather prevent infection side seasonal flu vaccine may follow subject saes aes checking minor subset subject day seroprotection wealth previous clinical trial data mileage may vary depending ultimate goal product prevention v treatment multiple trial previously v first human etc term safety data injection site reaction anaphylaxis rear short order dose administration showstopper subject diary aes aes special interest common least first sometimes first day safety follow end around month case month even patient reported aes saes sporadic contact point final visit safety lab usually required throughout study unless clinically indicated vaccine trial special guideline like study protocol meet scientific safety bar fda ema whoever belief need clear including capture long term effect entirely sure entail punt back sponsor,anger
"That's a good question.  I believe tha what the trials are looking at as the primary efficacy endpoint are antibody (immunoglobulin) titers against the virus as a surrogate marker for immunity. Since the patients/subjects are not being deliberately exposed to Covid-19, only long-term followup will reveal how effective the vaccines are for preventing infection and for decreasing the severity of infections. I don't know how long follow-up time for safety will be.

"The growing regulatory support for Real-World Data (RWD) and Real-World Evidence (RWE) in clinical trials signifies a shift towards acknowledging the value of data collected outside traditional clinical trial settings. The FDA and MHRA have issued guidance and perspectives on leveraging RWD and RWE in clinical research, reflecting a progressive stance on integrating these real-world sources into evaluating medical products and therapies. 

The potential for significant rise and beyond depends on various factors:

* **Regulatory Clarity and Standards:** The recent guidance by regulatory bodies like the FDA and MHRA provides a more defined guideline for using RWD and RWE. If these guidelines continue to evolve, become more specific, and address concerns about data quality, reliability, and methodologies, it will encourage adopting the data widely.
* **Data Quality and Integrity:** Trust in the quality and reliability of RWD is necessary. Advancements in data collection, validation, and approaches to ensure data integrity will boost confidence in using real-world data in clinical trials.
* **Technological Advancements:** Advancements in data analytics contribute to the improved analysis and interpretation of RWD. As technology progresses, it will enhance the validity and reliability of real-world evidence in practical environments.

Likely, the growing regulatory support and an increased understanding of the value of RWD and RWE will drive the drug development process to the next level in the upcoming years. However, the rate of adoption might vary among organizations, depending on their readiness to embrace these sources, the clarity of regulations, the quality and availability of data, and the advancement of supporting technologies.

"A vaccine for eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), western  equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), and Venezuelan equine encephalitis  virus (VEEV) was found to be safe, well-tolerated and induced a  neutralizing antibody response in adult volunteers, according to newly  published results from a Phase 1 clinical trial. The vaccine candidate  was developed by scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and  Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center (VRC), part of the  National Institutes of Health. NIAID also sponsored and funded the  clinical trial, which was conducted at the Emory Vaccine Center’s Hope  Clinic, part of Emory University in Atlanta. The study appears online  today in *The Lancet Infectious Diseases*.

EEEV, WEEV and VEEV are spread to humans through the bites of  infected mosquitoes. Horses are also susceptible to infection, but  horses cannot transmit the viruses directly to humans. Infections in  humans are rare but can lead to flu-like symptoms and, in some cases,  severe neurological damage or death. The viruses have caused recurrent,  small outbreaks in North, Central and South America, including [an EEEV outbreak in 2019 in the northeastern United States](https://www.cdc.gov/easternequineencephalitis/statistics-maps/index.html) that led to 38 confirmed cases and 15 deaths.

Under certain laboratory conditions, the viruses can transmit through  the air by aerosol droplets and cause infection in humans and are  therefore classified as [priority pathogens](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/emerging-infectious-diseases-pathogens), potential biological agents that pose a risk to national security and public health. NIAID Director [Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., and colleagues have highlighted the possible utility of a vaccine for EEEV](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/eastern-equine-encephalitis-virus-poses-emergent-threat-say-niaid-officials) for people at high occupational risk of contracting the disease, including members of the military and laboratory workers. 

Building on their successful development of a vaccine for chikungunya  virus, VRC researchers designed a virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine  candidate (abbreviated WEVEE) that uses proteins from the outer shells  of the EEE, WEE and VEE viruses to prompt an immune response. VLPs do  not contain the genetic material that the viruses need to replicate  inside cells, so VLPs cannot cause infection.

For the Phase 1 clinical trial, 30 healthy adult volunteers ages 18  to 50 years received varying doses of the WEVEE vaccine (6, 30 or 60  micrograms) by intramuscular injection. Participants then returned to  receive the same dose as a boost eight weeks later. Some participants  also received a formulation of the experimental vaccine that contained  an alum adjuvant added to increase immune responses. Investigators  report that the vaccine was safe, well-tolerated and induced durable  immune responses against all three viruses. The highest neutralizing  antibody response was observed in participants who received the  30-microgram dose with adjuvant. The authors note that the findings  support further clinical evaluation of the vaccine candidate.

NIAID has executed a commercialization license for the advanced  development of the WEVEE vaccine candidate to the life sciences company  Emergent BioSolutions in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

Funding for manufacturing of WEVEE clinical trial material and  pre-clinical studies was funded in part by an Interagency Agreement  between NIAID and the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) Joint Program  Executive Office Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense  (JPEO-CBRND).

"Hi everyone! I'm a CTN for a large hospital on the east side in oncology research. I make around 110k annually and I'd like to move on and up, but the problem is that I am unaware of the available options and positions out there relating to what I do. I don’t want to get my NP or move up to nurse leader/manager as I have been put off by the politics and red tape it comes with (seems like managers are used as a moat by higher ups to keep lower levels from ruffling feathers while keeping them just efficient enough).

Right now I do mostly patient facing responsibilities as a clinical research nurse- assess patients who can potentially enroll/go over toxicities/eligibility criteria, and coordinate the care with PIs/MDs while patients are on study. I really don’t communicate with sponsors since that is the responsibility of CRAs/CRCs/CRMs etc., but i am in constant communication with them. CRAs and CRCs do not make as much as I do in my organization, and if they do, cant be much more. Probably the PMs and CRMs make more but I'm not too sure.

I'm intrigued by the data/regulatory side of things, dealing with the startup of the study, coordinating logistics, communicating with sponsor, etc.. and I feel like they have the potential to climb to higher earning positions. especially at CROs and pharma companies, Is this correct?

I guess my questions are:

* Can someone tell me the opportunities available to me relevant to my experience and what to look at further? 
* Do CROs value RN/CTN experience much (and for which positions)? 
* Does it pay to take a CRA job that doesn't necessarily care about my RN/CTN experience just to climb that ladder for a higher potential income? 
* Are CROs the best places to work in research in terms of pay?

"So just to be clear and make sure we're all speaking the same language... CTM is a very specific position in industry, at a CRO or sponsor (pharma or biotech) company. CRA is a clinical research associate, aka CRA or ""monitor,"" also working directly for a CRO or sponsor company. When referring to these positions on this sub, people are almost always if not always talking about these specific positions in industry, and \*not\* jobs at academic insitutions/hospitals.

I wanted to post because I don't know how you'd be able to ""take things off \[your CTM's\] table"" when you don't even work at the same company... so I am assuming you are really talking about your clinical research manager/program manager/trial manager (different sites/hospitals have different titles)... but these are very different than all the opportunities everyone here is referencing over in industry. Also, not sure if sometimes when you say ""CRA"" you actually mean clinical research assistants that also work at your site... again, very different than the industry CRA role (aka monitor.)

While you're on the site side, your connection to industry is through the industry CRAs - the monitors that monitor your data. Do the coordinators/assistants you work with host monitoring visits? try to join those visits and meet industry CRAs that way.

The other way you have a connection with industry is probably through email. If you have eligibility questions for example, you might be the one to email the industry CTM directly (sometimes it's the coordinators who do the emailing, though.)

SORRY if this was overly basic of a description, but I just realized that some research nurses don't really know the industry lingo so I wanted to be crystal clear!! There are a lot of similar job titles for veryyyy different jobs.

So with this in mind, the best route over to industry (where the money and opportunities are) is to apply for (industry) CRA roles and  you'll probably have to do a training program. Yes, CROs and sponsors value nursing backgrounds for sure, but how to monitor trial data is still very different than standard of care so you'll have to do a training.

"Hi everyone! 

So I am currently a research associate at start up CRO where I don't really have KPIs and have experience in everything (project management, audits, monitoring etc.) But I really really hate my job and where I'm working at the moment. There's not that many entry level CRM/CTM jobs where I'm based (East Africa) but I got the opportunity to apply to be a Quality manager at an international pharmaceutical company. My concern is that it's not specifically clinical trials and that is what I want to do for the rest of my career so I just wanted to ask if there's anyone here who's migrated from quality to trial management and if that's a realistic career progression in this field? Any tips or tricks of what I could do during this job to better place me a CTM role?

"Hello everyone, this question is ooen for anyone who would like to answer.

I am looking to talk to anyone who works in the profession of clinical trials weather it be a clinical research coordinator, a physician, or technologist.   

I have a few questions for a novel i am writing is about participants involved in a clinical trial.  I would love to talk to someone regarding general fact checking as well as  some specific questions i will list below:

1. How are participants interviewed and chosen for clincial trials?  And who does the in-person interviewing?  What questions are generally asked? 

2. My story involves subjects in a sleep clinical trial involving a sleep drug?  In the story the trial lasts about a month.  Would it be abnormal  for the subjects to be residing at the facility during the 1 month trial?  Is this realistic or feasable? 

3.  During the story the reaserchers are attempting to see how well the drug works while the participants are asleep, the drug involves dreams.  I plan on this being the 1st phase out of the isial 3 phases a clinical trial goes through.  From what i understand on a forst phase o ly side affects are usually assesed?  Would it be possoble for efficacy of a drug to be gestes in the first phase?

"# Significance of Data Quality 

Data Quality is of great significance for clinical research professionals when it comes to optimizing a current system or implementing a new clinical trial management system. It is essential to create processes that result in accurate, timely and complete data. As a result, it leads to more efficient workflows and minimized anxiety in reporting. However, quality data is not an impromptu thing, it is the outcome of a lot of planning and execution. 

There are several characteristics of data quality that are kept in mind by clinical research professionals while capturing data. These are taught to students while they are enrolled in [clinical research courses](https://www.technobridge.in/clinical-research/clinical-research-courses-scope-career-salary-syllabus-eligibility/).

**Characteristics of Data Quality** 

There are seven diverse characteristics that define data quality. They are: 

I. Accuracy and Precision 

II. Legitimacy and Validity 

III. Reliability and Consistency

IV. Timeliness and Relevance

V. Completeness and Comprehensiveness

VI. Availability and Accessibility

VII. Granularity and Uniqueness

In addition to that, there are three areas that clinical research professionals keep in mind while starting a data quality initiative

**I. Prioritize their needs first**

Research Organizations often make one common mistake which is attempting to address all their data quality issues in one go. They often have the pressure to justify both costs and resources needed for the project. As a result, it leads to unrealistic expectations in that particular research organization. Instead of setting unrealistic expectations, a research organization should focus on prioritizing their biggest needs first. They could do so by doing a cost benefit analysis which determines whether certain data points are worth being tracked. While prioritizing specific data points, here are some questions that should be asked:

[https://www.technobridge.in/clinical-research/clinical-research-courses-scope-career-salary-syllabus-eligibility/](https://www.technobridge.in/clinical-research/clinical-research-courses-scope-career-salary-syllabus-eligibility/)

• Is the data relevant to multiple areas

• Does it support large organizational goals 

• Does the data gathered require other data to be present.

When clinical research professionals ask the above questions, they will not only be able to prioritize goals first. Also they would be able to collect data accurately and consistently with ease.

**II. Assessing data collecting and monitoring processes** 

After the process of prioritizing data points, clinical researchers should review their methods for data gathering and monitoring . Inferior data is more dangerous for clinical research organizations than no data at all. Therefore, it is vital for organizations to start these processes before they go live. 

Monitoring needs to be clearly defined both from a personnel perspective that is who is responsible for data integrity and a process perspective i.e. What tools and the reports does the person use to make certain that processes are being followed.

This is also the perfect time to review the processes of other teams in the organization. Standardizing your collection and monitoring workflows throughout your organization isn’t a necessity, it can help boost data consistency across teams, especially if those teams are using the same Clinical Trial Management System

**Certain Tools that ensure ongoing success**

The third step after prioritizing goals and reviewing processes is to give research staff the tools to efficiently maintain these processes. Tools could help identify missing data for both protocol’s and subjects. These tools would help you fulfill the goal of prioritizing important needs and fixing those errors first.

"One would need a hell of a lot more information about the program to give a sensible answer.

The absolute fastest you would ever see from a pivotal study topline to first dosing in a commercial setting (outside of a clinical trial) is about 9 months. That would break down as \~3 months after database lock to finalize database, CSR, data submission package, and eCTD submission package. The other 6 months is regulatory review assuming priority review is granted. Add another 6 months if no priority review. Add an indefinite amount of time if the program gets a CRL.

For things that mess with DNA directly (like CRISPR-based treatments and gene therapies) I would be shocked out of my mind to see a new therapeutic class approved in 6 months from package submission. The manufacturing side of that package would be much more complicated and likely to generate items that would delay the approval process, though the specifics of that are far outside my personal expertise.

There are approved gene therapies on the market in various rare diseases (SMA is probably the best known example). There are no commercially approved CRISPR drugs on the market, globally, right now AFAIK. I believe Vertex's exacel program is the closest.

We are based out of SW Pennsylvania, but have easy access to West Virginia, Ohio, Maryland, New York, etc.  We currently operate in PA and WV but want to be able to travel via mobile site from state to state.  

Next is obtaining the studies themselves.  I'm not sure whether it would be more prudent to build out the project then seek studies that would benefit from the model OR vice-versa.  We currently have numerous swab studies for COV/FLU/RSV/STREP that are not complex and could easily be done mobile.   Would it be possible to use a protocol amendment (or some executable document) to retroactively include a mobile site(s)?  (Assuming Sponsor agrees).

Lastly would be about operations in general.  For example, is there a PI that travels with the mobile site from location to location full time?  Like most SMOs, our PIs are independent contractors that operate their own practices, and are thus unlikely to leave just for research.  We've thought of attracting recent grads or low-men/women on the totem-poll by providing strong financial and career incentives, but we haven't done much beyond speculate.

"Don’t feel bad or get stressed. You’re just really new to clinical research and that’s ok. Many of us have been there before. Just know, it’ll take time to see where your skills can be applied, but the skills you listed can translate really well into clinical research. 

Your role is in specimen management, which is a really important role in the clinical trial. All the science they talk about in meetings is because they analyzed samples like the one you’re going to be managing. It’s this data that will eventually be the basis for the application to the FDA for drug approval (if in the US). 

For your role, I’d suggest focusing on all the tid-bits about the timing of sample collection, processing, and shipping. Reading the Protocol will help, but the Lab Manual is more important for what you’re going to do. Both are important tho. Read the protocol or lab manual like instruction manuals. The table of contents is your friend. There are several sections in a protocol, but the main section to start in is the X-page (study calendar/schedule of events). Use this as your map essentially. Then read each of the sections for when the subject is getting samples drawn, like in screening, treatment and when they’re off trial. Try building a mental map of how you see the workflow working at your site within the framework of the lab manual/protocol.

Create notes or checklists may help organize the important info like sponsor or kit order info and other things you may need, even file management on your computer. Sooner or later, you’ll remember/retain more. Also, logistics is really important here because bad sample management and organization can ruin the integrity of the study and can cause all kinds of issues.

There’s going to be a lot of info that may not pertain to you or your role, but it can help you understand the trials’ goals. You’re not going to know or understand everything two month in but eventually you’ll understand what they mean and if that info pertains to you.

"I can't provide an example, but I have tried this with my current CRO for two studies now.

It did not improve study compliance as easily as I'd hoped.

If the data entry is not up to date, or the site didn't realize that there is a lag between entering the data and the updated calendar, or the subject is there for a visit and the site has to wait for an updated calendar but they want to plan the next visit before the subject leaves clinic so they just guess...then problems occur.

It also depends what dates your visits are scheduled from, and if there are events or visits that modify the future calculations. It has been useful for some sites, but others have found it not as useful. Perhaps it would be better if it functioned more immediately, like if the data were entered and the calendar immediately updated...but it is so important for the visit dates to match what's in EDC, so having the site enter it twice (once for the calendar, once for EDC) allows for potential error, just like excel would.

" Thanks in advance for reading the post and answering the questions. 

As the title suggests, I would like to try and get a job in the industry. I'm currently working in software development as a QA engineer. 

The main reason for the change is that over the years it has ceased to be challenging and meaningful to me, which is eroding my passion for the job. Clinical trials seem to be something that could reignite my passion, at least I hope so. I have read a lot of clinical trial reports over the last three years and it has become more and more interesting to me. 

I'm not going into the industry expecting it to be easy or well paid. I have enough money saved up to survive a significant pay cut. I'm just looking for a new challenge.

And I know that ""working in clinical trials"" is a very broad term that describes many different roles. Just answer about the role you know about or the one you think is realistic for me.

So, my questions are:

1. Which degree would be best? I'm considering going back to university to study either Biology or Biotechnology to achieve my goal. Is there a significant difference between the two in terms of job prospects? Or is there another degree that would be even better?

2. Can my years of experience as a QA Engineer be used in any way? I currently have 4 years of experience and should have another 2-3 years by the time I seriously start looking for a job in another industry. Should I start looking for QA jobs in biotech companies?

3. I'm about to graduate in bioethics. Can it help in any way? As far as the curriculum is concerned, it's more like a philosophy course with a focus on ethics.

4. Is a one-year postgraduate course in ""Clinical Trial Design and Monitoring"" worthwhile, or will I be wasting my time and money?

2. Yes! There are QA professionals in research as well, but those skills may not be as transferrable as skills you may also have like understanding research ethics, how to design processes, or programming/data management tasks.

3. Yes! Understanding research ethics is important for any professional 

4. Answer to #4 depends on the answer #1. In most cases, getting a degree or doing a training program in clinical research is not an effective way of advancing your career vs. doing an entry level career 

General tips for you to do now:
- take one of the free GCP courses (like NIH)
- get a mentor in your bioethics program that concentrates on research ethics, review boards, or do a project that can have you get experience rounding as an hospital ethicist. Some roles require you to demonstrate you understand patient care
- learn more about research to understand what transferrable skills you need to emphasize on a resume
- ask yourself why you’d wait 2-3 years for a career change when you could just start applying now- experience trumps education every time in this industry.

Hello all,

I have a masters in epidemiology and biostatistics. I have recently joined an academic trials unit in the UK last year as a trials coordinator.

Never worked in pharma but that's where I want to be because my perception is that it's fast-paced there, where you see your efforts into outputs sooner and a good career trajectory in terms of promotions i.e. Trial manager etc? I am loving the trial management experience and challenges already.

1. How to make the transition to pharma as I have been in the UK for the first time and do not have any/much contacts especially due to work from home in COVID times?
2. What should I expect as a position in pharma if I work in academia for 2 years as a trials coordinator for at least 2 studies (one study has 45+ sites). I already have several publications and a couple more to come this year.
3. How do you see the need of PhD to move higher in the designation in pharma later down the career path e.g., at Director or Global Operations or Global Study manager role? Or should I focus on certifications more?

Trying to work out my plans.. let's hear your insights as part of parallel mentoring.

Thanks all.

"Hi

I work as a CRC in oncology at a large academic hospital in NYC. I have a total of ~1.5 years of total experience as a CRC (and I have a masters degree in biomedical science). I really like my job but the CRC salary isn’t cutting it. I’m very interested in clinical trials and my endgoal is to work on the sponsor side of clinical trials.

I’ve been looking for roles like Clinical Trial Manager, Site Manager, Study Manager on LinkedIn (I know I don’t have enough experience but I do have a friend who got referred a job at a huge pharma company as a clinical trial manager with only 18 months of CRC experience). But I’m having no luck applying.

Do you have suggestions for other roles? CRA or CTA/jobs at CROs? Or any advice on how to effectively jump roles/get a higher title at other companies? It seems like they want people with 5+ years of experience but I’m starting to outgrow my position and need to transition.

"Hey! 

Info about me -  currently a CRC on an academic research facility. Going on my third year in research. 2 years previously at ICON doing phase 1 pharmaceutical. No bachelors degree. Hoping to apply as a CRA in Julyish. 

From what I have gathered/heard from the past few year about moving up. 

CRC- CRA- CTM/(maybe PM?) 
(I’m not sure where a CT associate would fit on here. I think it is around CRC) 

- Bachelors degree in anything (although medical may be more helpful) and of course a masters degree would be great as well
- CCRP certified (Socra or ACRP) 
- Regulatory experience is a plus
-3 years of experience. From what I have seen phase 2+ experience is more valuable, but may depend on what you are looking for. I interviewed for CRA at ICON and the ones that interviewed me had never done phase one research and phase one seemed much different than what I interviewed for. 

It does seem that the market is not doing well right now. It is much more difficult to get a CRA job than it was 2 years ago. 

Companies you could consider applying for 
PPD
IQVIA
MEDPACE

SYNEOS

**Trial Overview**

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals' NCT04603878 is a phase 2a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ALN-TTRsc501 in patients with transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR). ATTR is a rare, progressive, and fatal genetic disorder that is caused by the production of an abnormal form of the transthyretin (TTR) protein. The abnormal TTR protein forms amyloid fibrils, which can deposit in various tissues throughout the body, including the heart, nerves, and eyes. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including heart failure, peripheral neuropathy, and vision loss.

**Study Design**

The NCT04603878 clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either ALN-TTRsc501 or placebo. The primary endpoint of the study is the change from baseline in the N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level at 24 weeks. NT-proBNP is a protein that is released by the heart in response to stress. A decrease in NT-proBNP level indicates a reduction in cardiac stress.

**Study Participants**

The NCT04603878 clinical trial will enroll patients with ATTR who have a history of heart failure or peripheral neuropathy. Patients must be at least 18 years old and have a life expectancy of at least 12 months.

**Study Interventions**

ALN-TTRsc501 is an RNAi therapeutic that is designed to silence the gene that produces the abnormal TTR protein. ALN-TTRsc501 is administered as an intravenous infusion.

**Study Results**

The NCT04603878 clinical trial is still ongoing. The results of the study are not yet available.

**Trial Status**

The NCT04603878 clinical trial is currently recruiting patients. The study is expected to be completed in 2024.

**Conclusion**

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals' NCT04603878 is a phase 2a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ALN-TTRsc501 in patients with ATTR. The study is still ongoing, and the results are not yet available. However, the results of previous studies suggest that ALN-TTRsc501 may be a promising treatment for ATTR.",2,trial overview alnylam pharmaceutical nct phase clinical trial evaluate safety efficacy aln ttrsc patient transthyretin amyloidosis attr attr rare progressive fatal genetic disorder caused production abnormal form transthyretin ttr protein abnormal ttr protein form amyloid fibril deposit various tissue throughout body including heart nerve eye lead variety symptom including heart failure peripheral neuropathy vision loss study design nct clinical trial randomized double blind placebo controlled trial patient randomly assigned receive either aln ttrsc placebo primary endpoint study change baseline n terminal pro b type natriuretic peptide nt probnp level week nt probnp protein released heart response stress decrease nt probnp level indicates reduction cardiac stress study participant nct clinical trial enroll patient attr history heart failure peripheral neuropathy patient must least year old life expectancy least month study intervention aln ttrsc rnai therapeutic designed silence gene produce abnormal ttr protein aln ttrsc administered intravenous infusion study result nct clinical trial still ongoing result study yet available trial status nct clinical trial currently recruiting patient study expected completed conclusion alnylam pharmaceutical nct phase clinical trial evaluate safety efficacy aln ttrsc patient attr study still ongoing result yet available however result previous study suggest aln ttrsc may promising treatment attr,fear
" The future of clinical trials is bright, with many exciting trends on the horizon. Here are some of the most promising trends to watch for:

* **Decentralized trials:** Decentralized trials (DCTs) are a type of clinical trial that is conducted remotely, with patients participating from their homes or other convenient locations. DCTs offer a number of advantages over traditional clinical trials, including increased patient convenience, reduced costs, and improved recruitment and retention rates.
* **Wearable devices:** Wearable devices, such as fitness trackers and smartwatches, are increasingly being used in clinical trials to collect data on patient health and activity levels. This data can be used to monitor patients' progress over time and to identify potential side effects.
* **Artificial intelligence (AI):** AI is being used in clinical trials to automate tasks, such as data analysis and patient recruitment. AI can also be used to develop new algorithms for predicting patient outcomes.
* **Real-world evidence (RWE):** RWE is data collected from real-world settings, such as electronic health records (EHRs) and patient registries. RWE can be used to supplement data from clinical trials and to better understand the safety and effectiveness of treatments in the real world.
* **Precision medicine:** Precision medicine is a type of medicine that takes into account a patient's individual genetic makeup and other factors to tailor treatment to their specific needs. Precision medicine is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we treat diseases.

These are just a few of the trends that are shaping the future of clinical trial research. As these technologies continue to develop, we can expect to see even more innovative and efficient ways to conduct clinical trials in the years to come.

Here are some additional trends that are worth mentioning:

* **Increased patient involvement:** Patients are becoming more involved in the design and conduct of clinical trials. This is leading to trials that are more patient-centered and that better meet the needs of patients.
* **Globalization of clinical trials:** Clinical trials are becoming increasingly globalized, with trials being conducted in multiple countries. This is being driven by the need to recruit a diverse patient population and to make trials more accessible to patients around the world.
* **Regulatory harmonization:** Regulatory agencies around the world are working to harmonize their regulations for clinical trials. This will make it easier to conduct clinical trials across borders and will help to speed up the development of new treatments.

These trends are all pointing to a future where clinical trial research is more efficient, more patient-centered, and more global. This is good news for patients, who will have access to new treatments more quickly and easily.

Here are some specific examples of how these trends are being used in clinical trials today:

* **Decentralized trials:** A recent study of a new treatment for Alzheimer's disease was conducted using a decentralized trial design. This allowed patients to participate in the trial from their homes, which made it more convenient for them and reduced the cost of the trial.
* **Wearable devices:** A study of a new treatment for obesity is using wearable devices to track patients' weight, activity levels, and sleep patterns. This data is being used to monitor patients' progress and to identify potential side effects.
* **Artificial intelligence:** AI is being used to develop new algorithms for predicting patient outcomes in clinical trials. This could help to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular treatment.
* **Real-world evidence:** A study of the effectiveness of a new cancer treatment is using real-world evidence from electronic health records. This data is being used to supplement data from clinical trials and to better understand the safety and effectiveness of the treatment in the real world.
* **Precision medicine:** A study of a new treatment for cancer is using precision medicine to tailor the treatment to each patient's individual genetic makeup. This could help to improve the effectiveness of the treatment.

These are just a few examples of how the future of clinical trials is being shaped by technology. As these technologies continue to develop, we can expect to see even more innovative and efficient ways to conduct clinical trials in the years to come. This will help to accelerate the development of new treatments and make them available to patients more quickly.",2,future clinical trial bright many exciting trend horizon promising trend watch decentralized trial decentralized trial dcts type clinical trial conducted remotely patient participating home convenient location dcts offer number advantage traditional clinical trial including increased patient convenience reduced cost improved recruitment retention rate wearable device wearable device fitness tracker smartwatches increasingly used clinical trial collect data patient health activity level data used monitor patient progress time identify potential side effect artificial intelligence ai ai used clinical trial automate task data analysis patient recruitment ai also used develop new algorithm predicting patient outcome real world evidence rwe rwe data collected real world setting electronic health record ehrs patient registry rwe used supplement data clinical trial better understand safety effectiveness treatment real world precision medicine precision medicine type medicine take account patient individual genetic makeup factor tailor treatment specific need precision medicine still early stage potential revolutionize way treat disease trend shaping future clinical trial research technology continue develop expect see even innovative efficient way conduct clinical trial year come additional trend worth mentioning increased patient involvement patient becoming involved design conduct clinical trial leading trial patient centered better meet need patient globalization clinical trial clinical trial becoming increasingly globalized trial conducted multiple country driven need recruit diverse patient population make trial accessible patient around world regulatory harmonization regulatory agency around world working harmonize regulation clinical trial make easier conduct clinical trial across border help speed development new treatment trend pointing future clinical trial research efficient patient centered global good news patient access new treatment quickly easily specific example trend used clinical trial today decentralized trial recent study new treatment alzheimer disease conducted using decentralized trial design allowed patient participate trial home made convenient reduced cost trial wearable device study new treatment obesity using wearable device track patient weight activity level sleep pattern data used monitor patient progress identify potential side effect artificial intelligence ai used develop new algorithm predicting patient outcome clinical trial could help identify patient likely benefit particular treatment real world evidence study effectiveness new cancer treatment using real world evidence electronic health record data used supplement data clinical trial better understand safety effectiveness treatment real world precision medicine study new treatment cancer using precision medicine tailor treatment patient individual genetic makeup could help improve effectiveness treatment example future clinical trial shaped technology technology continue develop expect see even innovative efficient way conduct clinical trial year come help accelerate development new treatment make available patient quickly,joy

">	Do you know how many clinical trials for a herpes cure there have been? ZERO. And very few for vaccines.

I’m not sure this is historically accurate. There have been [many HSV vaccine candidates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3324142/) as far back as 1920, [several dozen as of this 2012 paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3324142/). 

Inactivated virus:


>	In the early 1920s the first vaccine was introduced as an inactivated virus, which was prepared from formalin-treated tissues of HSV-infected animals [36–38]. A heat- or ultraviolet-inactivated virus, grown in embryonic eggs, was proposed later (reviewed in [37, 39]). Subsequent vaccines strategies changed from inactivated to replication-defective HSV strains such as virulent type HSV mutants (i.e., lacking ICP8, ICP10, dl5-29, or VHS), discontinuously replicating virus known as “disabled infectious single cycle” or “DISC”, and a virus with a deletion of UL22, the late gene encoding glycoprotein H (gH) [40]. A DISC HSV-2 vaccine has entered clinical trials and has been found relatively safe with no serious adverse effects [41, 42]. 

Active attenuated: 

>	The replication competent live virus vaccine approach has the advantages of stimulating a broad immune response (antibody, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells) and presenting all epitopes from the entire genome to generate multiimmune responses. A case of recurrent human genital HSV-2 disease caused by a thymidine kinase-deficient, mouse-virulent strain has been reported [44]. Mutations in thymidine kinase gene do not attenuate HSV-2 replication sufficiently when used as vaccines. A second live attenuated HSV strain developed for vaccine use is RAV 9395 [45]. This virus was derived from HSV-2 strain G and contains deletions of both copies of the virulence factor g134.5, UL55, and UL56. Clinical results have not been reported for this mutant. The most extensive human studies are available with attenuated live HSV vaccine strain R7020, created by Branco and Fraser [46]. This virus was originated from HSV-1 strain F and is attenuated by a deletion extending from UL54 (encoding ICP27) through the promoter region of ICP4. In a dose escalation study, local reactions and systemic side effects were noted in HSV-1-infected persons.

Recombinant viral vectors 

>	A number of trials have been pursued using recombinant live attenuated adenovirus and vaccinia recombinant viruses expressing HSV glycoproteins. These vaccines elicit Ag-specific CD8+ T cells after a single immunization [47–49]. Not surprisingly, no major vaccine company, in the USA or EU, is developing inactivated live vaccine candidates.

Naked DNA plasmid (sort of the spiritual predecessor to mRNA vaccine tech)

>	The concept of using naked DNA [28] as a vaccine is to introduce herpes antigenic genes into dendritic cells (DCs) for endogenous processing and presentation to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in draining lymph nodes or into other cells (e.g., epithelial cells) for cross-presentation by DCs, without the need for a viral vector. However, the competition within viral vector epitopes for endogenous processing reduced the efficacy. In addition the prior immunity to the viral vector and the potential dangers associated with a live virus are avoided when using DNA vaccines. Constitutive, tissue-specific promoters may be used for selective expression. The results of a number of plasmid DNA vaccine experiments in animal models of ocular and genital herpes have been reported [50]

And more. 

In the author’s words — And keeping in mind this is ten years old and mildly aging as science — basic microbiological knowledge deficit is still uncertain and has to be elucidated before cures or vaccines can be properly implemented:

>	In the past, dozens of vaccine immunotherapies have tried to stimulate the immune system against herpes, including about a dozen vaccines that reached mid- and late-stage clinical trials. Every single one of these therapies has generated much excitement, but, for the most part, none of those therapies really did protect against herpes.

>	Before devising more powerful treatments it is imperative to identify (i) the mechanisms underlying the suboptimal nonprotective immunity associated with natural infection, (ii) the major effectors of immunity that control each of the three phases of herpes infection (i.e., acute and latent), (iii) the sophisticated immune evasion strategies employed by HSV-1 and HSV-2 to dampen the immune response, (iv) the protective versus pathogenic protein Ag(s) among more than 80 immunogenic HSV proteins, and (v) a safe Ag delivery system.

In short, it has absolutely been studied, extensively, and given myriad of pathways to attempt a successful product; however, none have come to fruition.

"Yes. After repeated dosages for about 6 weeks, it permanently reduces depressive symptoms, even in treatment resistant depression. Those who undergo treatment may need a touch up every few months.

In depressed patients, neural activity and neural connections tend to prune. They get less excited by positive stimulus and those excitatory reactions become weaker over time. That’s why it’s very common for depressed patients to have more and more depressed episodes as time goes on; it’s easier when that becomes the brain’s default state.

Ketamine works uniquely from SSRIs. It causes neuronal regrowth and promotes brain plasticity. It’s as if your brain is in a developmental state again, learning to become more happy. SSRIs only work with what is already there— serotonin, dopamine, etc. —they don’t create any new connections, just make the process more efficient.

It could be argued that other psychoactive drugs could have positive effects. But ketamine works especially well because of its innate binding properties. Imagine ketamine and other psychoactive drugs as puzzle pieces and they fit into different spaces within the brain. Ketamine can connect with a receptor called NMDA, which other psychoactive drugs may not.

**TLDR: Ketamine makes new neuron connections to train the brain to be “happier”. Works better than other drugs because of its unique binding properties.**",3,yes repeated dosage week permanently reduces depressive symptom even treatment resistant depression undergo treatment may need touch every month depressed patient neural activity neural connection tend prune get le excited positive stimulus excitatory reaction become weaker time common depressed patient depressed episode time go easier becomes brain default state ketamine work uniquely ssri cause neuronal regrowth promotes brain plasticity brain developmental state learning become happy ssri work already serotonin dopamine etc create new connection make process efficient could argued psychoactive drug could positive effect ketamine work especially well innate binding property imagine ketamine psychoactive drug puzzle piece fit different space within brain ketamine connect receptor called nmda psychoactive drug may tldr ketamine make new neuron connection train brain happier work better drug unique binding property,sadness

It's not as if alcohol made that idea appear, no, the thought already existed, but not being sober is what made it actually come out, or at least turn the feeling into words to be communicated.

"The Alzheimer’s treatment donanemab, which is made by Eli Lilly, significantly slowed progression of the mind-robbing disease, according to clinical trial data released Wednesday by the company.

Patients who received the monthly antibody infusion during an 18-month study demonstrated a 35% slower decline in memory, thinking and their ability to perform daily activities compared with those who did not receive the treatment, Eli Lilly’s data showed.

Patients who took donanemab were 39% less likely to progress to the next stage of the disease during the study, according to the trial results.

But the treatment’s benefits will have to be weighed against the risk of brain swelling and bleeding that can be serious and even fatal in rare cases. Three participants in the trial died from these side effects.

**How scientists hope to beat the next coronavirus with nimbler vaccines**

https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/how-scientists-hope-to-beat-the-next-coronavirus-with-nimbler-vaccines/ar-AAW25Zd?ocid=uxbndlbing

>The idea is if a vaccine works against many relatives of the same genetic family now, it’d also work — at least in part — against future relatives, even if scientists don’t know yet what those are.

>Much of this research is already under way. Vaccine manufacturers are testing formulations of their products that cover multiple variants, and some of these updated versions could come to fruition in coming months. One major National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases trial started just last week at 24 U.S. sites to test various combinations of the current vaccine with others tailored to beta, delta and omicron. One of the locations is San Francisco General Hospital, which began recruiting volunteers Friday.

>Even better, and one step closer to a pan-coronavirus vaccine, would be vaccines that work on many sarbecoviruses, a subset of coronaviruses that includes SARS 1 and 2, as well as others that originate in bats and pangolins.

>Do we really need a variant-proof or a pan-coronavirus vaccine? The virus that causes COVID-19 will keep mutating, and we may need shots better tailored to target future variants — if the goal is to prevent infections, which many say is secondary to preventing severe illness and deaths. The current vaccines, when followed by a booster, already do the latter quite well.

>But looking beyond this pandemic, there is a good chance another coronavirus could transmit from animals to humans and once again cause global calamity. A pan-coronavirus vaccine could help contain that early.

>“We’ve had three coronavirus epidemics in the last 20 years,” said Dr. Drew Weissman, a leading vaccine researcher at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, who’s working on pan-coronavirus vaccines, referring to SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. “That tells us we’re going to have more. We have no idea when or how severe. We can wait for the next one to appear and rush to make a new vaccine and shut the world down for a year and a half. Or we can make one now so it’s ready to go.”

>Weissman’s lab is among at least half a dozen U.S. academic research institutions, biotech companies and groups of government scientists who are working on variations of such future-looking vaccines. At least one has begun human clinical trials, and several have found promising early results in monkey or mice studies. Many are focusing on the spike protein, the signature feature of coronaviruses, but some are also examining other parts of the virus that don’t mutate as quickly.

>Stanford immunologist Bali Pulendran is working with researchers at the University of Washington to develop a vaccine that protects against many variants of SARS-CoV-2. This could help pave the way for pan-sarbecovirus and ultimately pan-coronavirus vaccines.

>In a study Pulendran and his Stanford colleague Prabhu Arunachalam conducted last year on monkeys, the vaccine — when given with an adjuvant, a chemical that jump-starts the immune system — elicited a strong immune response against the Wuhan strain and the alpha and beta variants.

>The vaccine tested in that study is now in large phase 3 clinical trials. More recently, Pulendran’s work shows that this vaccine elicits a strong and durable immune response against not just the Wuhan strain, beta and delta — but also robust protection against omicron for at least six months.",1,related scientist hope beat next coronavirus nimbler vaccine idea vaccine work many relative genetic family also work least part future relative even scientist know yet much research already way vaccine manufacturer testing formulation product cover multiple variant updated version could come fruition coming month one major national institute allergy infectious disease trial started last week u site test various combination current vaccine others tailored beta delta omicron one location san francisco general hospital began recruiting volunteer friday even better one step closer pan coronavirus vaccine would vaccine work many sarbecoviruses subset coronaviruses includes sars well others originate bat pangolin really need variant proof pan coronavirus vaccine virus cause covid keep mutating may need shot better tailored target future variant goal prevent infection many say secondary preventing severe illness death current vaccine followed booster already latter quite well looking beyond pandemic good chance another coronavirus could transmit animal human cause global calamity pan coronavirus vaccine could help contain early three coronavirus epidemic last year said dr drew weissman leading vaccine researcher university pennsylvania perelman school medicine working pan coronavirus vaccine referring sars mers covid tell u going idea severe wait next one appear rush make new vaccine shut world year half make one ready go weissman lab among least half dozen u academic research institution biotech company group government scientist working variation future looking vaccine least one begun human clinical trial several found promising early result monkey mouse study many focusing spike protein signature feature coronaviruses also examining part virus mutate quickly stanford immunologist bali pulendran working researcher university washington develop vaccine protects many variant sars cov could help pave way pan sarbecovirus ultimately pan coronavirus vaccine study pulendran stanford colleague prabhu arunachalam conducted last year monkey vaccine given adjuvant chemical jump start immune system elicited strong immune response wuhan strain alpha beta variant vaccine tested study large phase clinical trial recently pulendran work show vaccine elicits strong durable immune response wuhan strain beta delta also robust protection omicron least six month,joy

This is a mistake.  Statin drugs (Lipitor is a statin drug), do work and they do extend life.  Statins are dirt cheap. They are available via both the Target and Walmart formularies.

"the best treatment for heart disease is getting up off your fat ass, eating less salt and meat while eating more fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking and decreasing alcohol intake, and fucking your wife as often as she'll let you. i'm so sick of everyone turning to little white/pink/blue/yellow/orange/rainbow/fascia colored pills to fix all their problems - especially heart disease. heart disease is mostly a consequence of lifestyle. same thing with strokes and hypertention. this medicated culture reminds me of brave new world and soma pills - take one and you'll never have to worry about anything ever again.

get fucked. 

EDIT/DISCLAIMER: I'm a nursing student, and I'm very well aware of the myriad factors involved in heart disease. Indeed, heart disease has genetic predispositions (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, arteriosclerosis, etc.), and one may be struck by heart disease despite leading a healthy lifestyle. However, approximately 50–55% of all disease states may be prevented by lifestyle change. Multiply that by 600 million Americans, and it's easy to see how McDonalds, Snickers, Budweiser, and Marlboro are slowly propagating our slow demise. 

My comment was a *gross generalization* using the idea of [concision](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cceC3DeFcY) to help communicate my point and personal frustration with our societal mentality of over medication, or ""miracle cures."" It's strikingly similar to the fountain of youth phenomenon.

Part of the reason these pharmaceuticals reduce us to a profit rather than considering these problems actual national health concerns is because the people (**i.e., we**) have allowed this to happen.

"Actually, organic non-factory-produced meat (raw, rare or at worst medium) is highly beneficial. Meat is the primary (and in some cases only) source of certain important nutrients, such as [carnitine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnitine), [Co-enzyme Q-10](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coenzyme_Q10) and [Vitamin B12](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B12). Co-enzyme Q10 is of interest in that it is important for heart health and, ironically, statin drugs like Lipitor (championed as a protector of the heart) actually create a Co-enzyme Q10 deficiency.

Sweet fruit should be eaten in moderation, and it's better to eat it instead of drinking juice, so that the fruit sugars don't hit your system quite as fast. Processed sugars and refined carboydrates (e.g. white bread, white rice, extruded breakfast cereals etc) are hugely detrimental to health and are associated not only with heart disease, but also diabetes, obesity, and cancer (for starters).

Small study size, design flaws, publication bias (failure to publish negative results or duplication of positive results), drug-industry influence, and the play of chance were among the problems Ioannidis found that caused false or exaggerated claims.""

""In his survey, one study found that industry-sponsored research was positive 87 percent of the time compared with 65 percent positive for research that was not industry sponsored. According to Gross, the evidence was overwhelming that “industry sponsorship was likely to yield pro-industry results.” A 2006 analysis published in the American Journal of Psychiatry found that 90 percent of manufacturer-sponsored studies of antipsychotic drugs led to claims that the study drug was as good as, or superior to, every other drug in its class.""

">*why do so many doctors stand behind these drugs, the money?*

That's one big reason among several, yes. Maybe not money directly, but there are always the nice little gifts, the friendly sales rep with his helpful ""research"" to save them time chasing down and analysing debate between researchers, and the corporate-sponsored medical conferences in exotic countries etc (I personally know a doctor who loves going on these every year). There's also the little item that if your research funding comes from corporations and ""non-profit"" organisations with funding links to the corporate world, you are less likely to want to bite the hand that feeds you.

Re the logic, isn't it pretty obvious? You have a drug that is supposed to promote heart health which actually puts it at risk. I feel sorry for the trusting people who suffered or perhaps even died before it was realised that statin-induced Co-enzyme Q10 deficiency causes serious harm. And the problems of statins aren't just related to CoQ10. Statins suppress one of the precursors of CoQ10 and cholesterol, [HMG-CoA reductase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMG-CoA_reductase). That enzyme is a precursor about half a dozen steps prior to cholesterol - which means that about five other substances besides cholesterol are suppressed when a statin drug is present. Cholesterol of course is used to make other things, like the sex hormones estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. Like bile, which helps with the absorbtion of fat and the fat soluble vitamins A, D, E and K. Like the ""stress hormone"" cortisol. Cholesterol is also a precursor for the body's synthesis of Vitamin D (so lowering it not only retards absorbtion of Vitamin D through food, but also retards your skin generating Vitamin D when sunshine hits it). Vitamin D is needed for proper bone mineralisation, and is also believed to have an anti-cancer effect. As well as the liver, the brain manufactures cholesterol but Lipitor can cross the blood-brain barrier and stop production there too. As cholesterol comprises a significant portion of the brain and is necessary for proper mental function, it is no wonder that slowness, forgetfulness, and even transient global amnesia are known symptoms of statin use.

I am related to someone who is taking Lipitor right now. He is taking co-enzyme Q10 and still suffering muscular aches and pains, and cannot raise his arms above shoulder-level any more, the pain is so great if he tries. He also suffers from an overwhelming tiredness shortly after taking his fix, and becomes a little slow at following the thread of conversations. His faith in his personal doctor is absolute, and no matter how many books written by DOCTORS I place in front of him to read, his faith in Lipitor and his Medical Priest sustain him like some sort of cult, even though I see it wearing him down before my despairing eyes. Interestingly, the white-coated Priest has been presented with Dr Graveline's first book on Lipitor, and did not choose to contend with it at all. His response to his patient was that ""the choice to stop or continue taking it is yours"".

When you learn from members of the international medical community that [high cholesterol has not been proven as the cause of heart disease](http://www.thincs.org) and how the stated reason for using statins is flawed by politics, profit and junk science, and there is no medically useful reason to take these dangerous statin drugs at all, you tend to want to boil over in fury.

HIV-Specific, Ex Vivo Expanded T Cell Therapy: Feasibility, Safety, and Efficacy in ART-Suppressed HIV-Infected Individuals.

Abstract:

Adoptive T cell therapy has had dramatic successes in the treatment of virus-related malignancies and infections following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We adapted this method to produce ex vivo expanded HIV-specific T cells (HXTCs), with the long-term goal of using HXTCs as part of strategies to clear persistent HIV infection. In this phase 1 proof-of-concept study (NCT02208167), we administered HXTCs to antiretroviral therapy (ART)-suppressed, HIV-infected participants. Participants received two infusions of 2 × 10 7 cells/m 2 HXTCs at a 2-week interval. Leukapheresis was performed at baseline and 12 weeks post-infusion to measure the frequency of resting cell infection by the quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA). Overall, participants tolerated HXTCs, with only grade 1 adverse events (AEs) related to HXTCs. Two of six participants exhibited a detectable increase in CD8 T cell-mediated antiviral activity following the two infusions in some, but not all, assays. As expected, however, in the absence of a latency reversing agent, no meaningful decline in the frequency of resting CD4 T cell infection was detected. HXTC therapy in ART-suppressed, HIV-infected individuals appears safe and well tolerated, without any clinical signs of immune activation, likely due to the low residual HIV antigen burden present during ART.

It's something to look out for and why the physician should be consulted. I understand what you're going through and any bit of hope helps but this is premature. While research is always promising, it is very very early. 

""Pharmacological ascorbate infusions may cause red blood cell hemolysis in those deﬁcient in the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme."" 

Another issue I have with this is that they used an IV based delivery method. With a GNC pill based delivery, it might not be as effective and the quantity of the vitamin may not be sufficient. Also, you probably run the risk of  GI disturbances and you don't want that on top of chemo. It can cause other issues such as iron overdose, interfere with blood clotting, and with other medications.

Here's some supplemental info of why you shouldn't try to replicate the results of a clinical trial on someone you care about and don't have the proper background or training. Especially on someone with cancer which could lead to other conditions and putting more pressure on various organ systems.

"You need to do more research. T2 diabetics are not treated exclusively with insulin therapy, as they have developed a high insulin tolerance. The treatment talked about in the article is clearly for T1 diabetics (a genetic condition triggered by a virus, not lifestyle) because they do not produce their own insulin due to their immune system having rendered the pancreas inactive.

Also, you listed Alzheimer's as a lifestyle disease. It isn't, it's genetic. There are things you can do to lower your odds of it developing, but it's largely determined by genetics. Not lifestyle, and certainly not diet.

Also, weight? Not the defining criteria for developing cancer. Not even close. Actually, old age is a far better indicator than weight in developing cancer. If you love long enough, you will develope cancer. Just saying.

As for Big Pharma getting people hooked on pills? You are placing blame in the wrong place. Pharmacies only fill the perscriotions that DOCTORS write. So place some blame on the people over prescribing narcotics.

Also, you say we aren't doing shit. If that is true, where is the research coming from? The statistics? How have we even compliled information to determine that there is a problem (because the first step to solving a problem is defining what the problem is)?

And after that, what about free will? You stated that millions of people die due to their dietary choices. The key word there is CHOICES. We are fortunate enough to be able to make our own choices, right or wrong.

Given your complaint about the healthcare system, I'd guess that you are in the US. Yes, our healthcare system is broken. It needs to be fixed.

While eliminating each additional one threat to the extremely immunocompromised is well and good, especially some of the more common afflictions, that still may not appreciably influence mortality figures because the same individuals that were liable to die of anything infectious whatsoever, especially the things other individuals typically survive, are still probably just as liable to die of something else.",0,indeed provided excellent example population demographic incredibly vulnerable kind insult whatsoever addressing individual risk factor may little effect upon overall mortality make point using one specific example mentioned severely immunocompromised individual vulnerable incredibly number variety opportunistic infection eliminating additional one threat extremely immunocompromised well good especially common affliction still may appreciably influence mortality figure individual liable die anything infectious whatsoever especially thing individual typically survive still probably liable die something else,fear
">	population demographics that are so incredibly vulnerable to any kind of insult whatsoever that addressing individual risk factors may have very little effect upon overall mortality.

Are you suggesting that infants who succumb to RSV would have otherwise died of another infection soon after?

This kind of thinking hardly seems productive. I was simply providing examples of groups which otherwise *can* have full recoveries from RSV and are not “on death’s door”, as you imply. It is reductionist to paint all of those who could benefit from this vaccine in that way.

If your goal is to simply dismiss all stats but total mortality figures then perhaps we should stop focusing on other minority illnesses also.",1,population demographic incredibly vulnerable kind insult whatsoever addressing individual risk factor may little effect upon overall mortality suggesting infant succumb rsv would otherwise died another infection soon kind thinking hardly seems productive simply providing example group otherwise full recovery rsv death door imply reductionist paint could benefit vaccine way goal simply dismiss stats total mortality figure perhaps stop focusing minority illness also,fear

"How is eating 75% of calories on one day and 125% of calories on the second day going to lead to weight loss?  I'm not even convinced eating 75% on one day even qualifies as ADF...

Not the greatest source, but...

> Our research has shown that people don't (or maybe even can't) binge on the feast day. When I started doing this research, I assumed that people would eat 175% of their calories on the feast day, to fully compensate for eating only 25% of their calories on the diet day. This isn't the case though. Our findings show that people only eat about 110% of their daily calories on the feast day, instead of the predicted 175%.

http://www.eoddiet.com/faq/

So 25% on day 1 and 110% on day 2; not 75% on day 1 and 125% on day 2.  The former is a diet that should result in weight loss, while the first should have no effect.

If you really think about it...

> alternate-day fasting does not produce superior weight loss or weight maintenance compared with daily calorie restriction.

"See other comments -- there is abundant evidence that pharmaceutical companies ""cherry pick"" data to publish, and studies that are neutral or negative tend to get buried and never see the light of day. I really have nothing against big companies or making a good profit (I own Eli Lilly stock), but there is much hype and questionable benefit in some touted treatments, and antidepressants just happen to be the best documented example. As for type I diabetes there is little dispute, but insulin was commercialized in 1922! Treatment of alzheimers is in the dark ages, and even the ""best"" current treatments are woefully short of the miracles of recovery depicted in numerous TV commercials -- the drug companies are selling hope to desperate families, but the reality is very much short of that. The parade of commercials for ""low-T"" is the latest marketing gimmick, taking a normal process of aging and  turning it into a ""disease"" that must be treated (and I'm not saying that true documented  hypogonadism should not be treated at all, just that the commercials confuse normal male aging with a disease process).  And I agree, not understanding the cause of a disease process has nothing to do with the success or lack thererof of a specific treatment - that success needs to be determined by careful double blind randomized controlled trials, which are accurately and completely reported to the wider scientific / medical community for analysis -- and too often the data gets ""lost"" if it is not as favorable as desired.

Just because they weren't included doesn't mean they should have been. I've known dozen of people on SSRI's, I work in the medical field, and have taken them. They work way beyond a placebo effect. This is especially noticeable when someone goes from a MAOI or cyclic to an SSRI; it's night and day. If it was placebo you wouldn't see that. 

As far as low T this is marketing. No reasons pharma should be banned from doing it. I'm more bothered by payoffs to doctors but that's different. It's up to the physician to decide if someone has a valid medical condition requiring treatment. And even if low T is a normal part of aging I really don't see the big deal in treating it to raise quality of life. We do that all the time for all sorts of things.

"Article requires registration but I probably know most of what they're saying. There is some debate about it but testosterone replacement therapy is a bit of a pet peeve for me. It's frowned on because of the potential for abuse but low T is a real problem for most men as they age. Even if it's normal for it to decline it still negatively impacts quality of life and should be treated for that reason alone when possible. It's just annoying that something so important is often not done just because some doctors are afraid of the stigma involved. 

I actually remember well when pharma advertising started. It was illegal for a very long time. I can still recall the debates about it on the various weekly news shows. You have a good point about the profit incentive but the flip side of that coin is it raises awareness of diseases and their treatment. A lot of average people are totally oblivious to their health problems and how impacted they are. These commercials help inform them and it's something that costs too much to do without a profit motive. 

As for the SSRI studies I really need to know why they were excluded before passing judgement. I don't see the FDA as deliberately participating in a scam on this level, although it's not impossible, and as I've said before I am convinced as to their efficacy.

"If I understand the abstract it says that not all of the research submitted to the FDA was published in peer reviewed journals but didn't say whether or not the FDA considered them but it seems like the FDA must have from this statement: 

> According to the published literature, it appeared that 94% of the trials conducted were positive. By contrast, the FDA analysis showed that 51% were positive.

Which means the published literature was selectively more positive than the FDA literature. If the FDA didn't consider the negative research there wouldn't be a gap. It just says they weren't published in independent, peer reviewed journals which is the fault of the respective journals. 

So what it seems happened is the companies submitted everything to the FDA, which the FDA considered as they should, and the pharma companies used influence to stop publication, or misrepresent the results, of negative articles in journals. Shouldn't have happened granted, although probably not illegal, but the FDA wasn't involved and the companies did report all relevant to the FDA which the FDA considered.

Having said all that I see where you're coming from with the belief they aren't as effective as many think.

Abstract

Objective:

Despite the staggering consequences of the opioid epidemic, limited nonopioid medication options have been developed to treat this medical and public health crisis. This study investigated the potential of cannabidiol (CBD), a nonintoxicating phytocannabinoid, to reduce cue-induced craving and anxiety, two critical features of addiction that often contribute to relapse and continued drug use, in drug-abstinent individuals with heroin use disorder.

Methods:

This exploratory double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial assessed the acute (1 hour, 2 hours, and 24 hours), short-term (3 consecutive days), and protracted (7 days after the last of three consecutive daily administrations) effects of CBD administration (400 or 800 mg, once daily for 3 consecutive days) on drug cue–induced craving and anxiety in drug-abstinent individuals with heroin use disorder. Secondary measures assessed participants’ positive and negative affect, cognition, and physiological status.

Results:

Acute CBD administration, in contrast to placebo, significantly reduced both craving and anxiety induced by the presentation of salient drug cues compared with neutral cues. CBD also showed significant protracted effects on these measures 7 days after the final short-term (3-day) CBD exposure. In addition, CBD reduced the drug cue–induced physiological measures of heart rate and salivary cortisol levels.

"I have recently started on probiotics for some weird digestive issues no one has been able to diagnose, so far no change- but I did my research beforehand so I feel I can share.  I agree with your food recommendations (also kefir is just so so tasty and awesome), but if you're looking for a pill, there are a couple things to keep in mind.  Number one, never buy unrefrigerated.  They virtually always are mostly dead by the time they hit the shelves.  Number two, quantity is super important in pills because so many of the bacteria will not actually reach their target, you are basically taking the ""brute force"" method, whereas with foods there is some protection and even with a smaller number of bacteria, more of them make it to your intestines.  In a pill, anything less than 10 billion is probably not worth taking.  Number three, you want maximum biodiversity so taking 50 billion Acidopholus is good but taking a 50 billion mix of 10 strains is even better.  Some companies have patents on the exact strain of a certain species that they use, so you can also buy 10 different sources of the same Biffidobacterium species and they will all be different, which is GOOD, you want the highest biodiversity you can get in your gut.  This is another reason foods are important, as they will get you a lot of unique strains.  Mix up your brand choices from time to time, too.

Abstract

Background

The colorectal cancer antigen GUCY2C exhibits unique split tolerance, evoking antigen-specific CD8+, but not CD4+, T-cell responses that deliver anti-tumor immunity without autoimmunity in mice. Here, the cancer vaccine Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE was evaluated in a first-in-man phase I clinical study of patients with early-stage colorectal cancer to assess its safety and immunological efficacy.

Methods

Ten patients with surgically-resected stage I or stage II (pN0) colon cancer received a single intramuscular injection of 1011 viral particles (vp) of Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE. Safety assessment and immunomonitoring were carried out for 6 months following immunization. This trial employed continual monitoring of both efficacy and toxicity of subjects as joint primary outcomes.

Results

All patients receiving Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE completed the study and none developed adverse events greater than grade 1. Antibody responses to GUCY2C were detected in 10% of patients, while 40% exhibited GUCY2C-specific T-cell responses. GUCY2C-specific responses were exclusively CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, mimicking pre-clinical studies in mice in which GUCY2C-specific CD4+ T cells are eliminated by self-tolerance, while CD8+ T cells escape tolerance and mediate antitumor immunity. Moreover, pre-existing neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to the Ad5 vector were associated with poor vaccine-induced responses, suggesting that Ad5 NAbs oppose GUCY2C immune responses to the vaccine in patients and supported by mouse studies.

Conclusions

Split tolerance to GUCY2C in cancer patients can be exploited to safely generate antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8+, but not autoimmune CD4+, T cells by Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE in the absence of pre-existing NAbs to the viral vector.",2,title post copy paste title subtitle first third paragraph linked academic press release novel vaccine colorectal cancer show positive phase result vaccine prof safe small sample human subject opening way next phase testing patient treated sign serious adverse event sample blood contained marker immune activation early indication vaccine could activate immune cell fight colorectal tumor metastasis colon cancer especially younger people rise currently second highest cause cancer death u worldwide journal reference split tolerance permit safe ad gucyc padre vaccine induced cell response colon cancer patient adam e snook trevor r baybutt bo xiang tara abraham john c flickingerjr terry hyslop tingting zhan walter k kraft takami sato scott waldman journal immunotherapy cancer link doi abstract background colorectal cancer antigen gucyc exhibit unique split tolerance evoking antigen specific cd cd cell response deliver anti tumor immunity without autoimmunity mouse cancer vaccine ad gucyc padre evaluated first man phase clinical study patient early stage colorectal cancer ass safety immunological efficacy method ten patient surgically resected stage stage ii pn colon cancer received single intramuscular injection viral particle vp ad gucyc padre safety assessment immunomonitoring carried month following immunization trial employed continual monitoring efficacy toxicity subject joint primary outcome result patient receiving ad gucyc padre completed study none developed adverse event greater grade antibody response gucyc detected patient exhibited gucyc specific cell response gucyc specific response exclusively cd cytotoxic cell mimicking pre clinical study mouse gucyc specific cd cell eliminated self tolerance cd cell escape tolerance mediate antitumor immunity moreover pre existing neutralizing antibody nabs ad vector associated poor vaccine induced response suggesting ad nabs oppose gucyc immune response vaccine patient supported mouse study conclusion split tolerance gucyc cancer patient exploited safely generate antigen specific cytotoxic cd autoimmune cd cell ad gucyc padre absence pre existing nabs viral vector,joy

The abuse potential of medical psilocybin according to the 8 factors of the Controlled Substances Act,

Abstract: 

This review assesses the abuse potential of medically-administered psilocybin, following the structure of the 8 factors of the US Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Research suggests the potential safety and efficacy of psilocybin in treating cancer-related psychiatric distress and substance use disorders, setting the occasion for this review. A more extensive assessment of abuse potential according to an 8-factor analysis would eventually be required to guide appropriate schedule placement. Psilocybin, like other 5-HT2A agonist classic psychedelics, has limited reinforcing effects, supporting marginal, transient non-human self-administration. Nonetheless, mushrooms with variable psilocybin content are used illicitly, with a few lifetime use occasions being normative among users. Potential harms include dangerous behavior in unprepared, unsupervised users, and exacerbation of mental illness in those with or predisposed to psychotic disorders.

>  A new type of cancer vaccine has yielded promising results in an initial clinical trial conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania. The personalized vaccine is made from patients’ own immune cells, which are exposed in the laboratory to the contents of the patients’ tumor cells, and then injected into the patients to initiate a wider immune response. The trial, conducted in advanced ovarian cancer patients, was a pilot trial aimed primarily at determining safety and feasibility, but there were clear signs that it could be effective: About half of the vaccinated patients showed signs of anti-tumor T-cell responses, and those “responders” tended to live much longer without tumor progression than those who didn’t respond. One patient, after two years of vaccinations, was disease-free for another five years without further treatment. The study is published today in Science Translational Medicine.

The personalized touch in cancer vaccination

> Transfer of autologous dendritic cells (DCs) has been investigated as a method of boosting T cell responses in therapeutic vaccines for several diseases. Tanyi et al. report the findings of a clinical study involving recurrent ovarian cancer patients. Patient DCs were pulsed with oxidized tumor lysate before transfer and given alone or in combination with immunomodulatory drugs. The DC vaccine was well tolerated and induced potent antitumor T cell responses, including to new epitopes, that correlated with better prognosis. These results suggest further testing of this vaccination regimen for inducing protective T cell immunity in cancer.

Abstract

> We conducted a pilot clinical trial testing a personalized vaccine generated by autologous dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with oxidized autologous whole-tumor cell lysate (OCDC), which was injected intranodally in platinum-treated, immunotherapy-naïve, recurrent ovarian cancer patients. OCDC was administered alone (cohort 1, n = 5), in combination with bevacizumab (cohort 2, n = 10), or bevacizumab plus low-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide (cohort 3, n = 10) until disease progression or vaccine exhaustion. A total of 392 vaccine doses were administered without serious adverse events. Vaccination induced T cell responses to autologous tumor antigen, which were associated with significantly prolonged survival. Vaccination also amplified T cell responses against mutated neoepitopes derived from nonsynonymous somatic tumor mutations, and this included priming of T cells against previously unrecognized neoepitopes, as well as novel T cell clones of markedly higher avidity against previously recognized neoepitopes. We conclude that the use of oxidized whole-tumor lysate DC vaccine is safe and effective in eliciting a broad antitumor immunity, including private neoantigens, and warrants further clinical testing.",3,title post copy paste first paragraph linked academic press release new type cancer vaccine yielded promising result initial clinical trial conducted perelman school medicine university pennsylvania abramson cancer center university pennsylvania personalized vaccine made patient immune cell exposed laboratory content patient tumor cell injected patient initiate wider immune response trial conducted advanced ovarian cancer patient pilot trial aimed primarily determining safety feasibility clear sign could effective half vaccinated patient showed sign anti tumor cell response responder tended live much longer without tumor progression respond one patient two year vaccination disease free another five year without treatment study published today science translational medicine journal reference personalized cancer vaccine effectively mobilizes antitumor cell immunity ovarian cancer janos l tanyi sara bobisse eran ophir sandra tuyaerts annalisa roberti raphael genolet petra baumgartner brian j stevenson christian iseli denarda dangaj brian czerniecki aikaterini semilietof julien racle alexandra michel ioannis xenarios cheryl chiang dimitri mono drew torigian harvey l nisenbaum olivier michielin carl h june bruce l levine daniel j powel jr david gfeller rosemarie mick urania dafni vincent zoete alexandre harari george coukos lana e kandalaft science translational medicine apr vol issue eaao doi scitranslmed aao link personalized touch cancer vaccination transfer autologous dendritic cell dc investigated method boosting cell response therapeutic vaccine several disease tanyi et al report finding clinical study involving recurrent ovarian cancer patient patient dc pulsed oxidized tumor lysate transfer given alone combination immunomodulatory drug dc vaccine well tolerated induced potent antitumor cell response including new epitope correlated better prognosis result suggest testing vaccination regimen inducing protective cell immunity cancer abstract conducted pilot clinical trial testing personalized vaccine generated autologous dendritic cell dc pulsed oxidized autologous whole tumor cell lysate ocdc injected intranodally platinum treated immunotherapy naïve recurrent ovarian cancer patient ocdc administered alone cohort n combination bevacizumab cohort n bevacizumab plus low dose intravenous cyclophosphamide cohort n disease progression vaccine exhaustion total vaccine dos administered without serious adverse event vaccination induced cell response autologous tumor antigen associated significantly prolonged survival vaccination also amplified cell response mutated neoepitopes derived nonsynonymous somatic tumor mutation included priming cell previously unrecognized neoepitopes well novel cell clone markedly higher avidity previously recognized neoepitopes conclude use oxidized whole tumor lysate dc vaccine safe effective eliciting broad antitumor immunity including private neoantigens warrant clinical testing,anger

> In their phase 1b clinical trial, published in Nature, participants stopped taking antiretroviral drugs and subsequently received three infusions of the two bNAbs over the course of six weeks. The researchers report that, among nine individuals who carried viruses that were sensitive to both antibodies, this treatment suppressed HIV for an average of 21 weeks, and over 30 weeks in some patients. Unlike individuals receiving only one bNAb, those receiving combination therapy did not develop resistance if their viruses were sensitive to the antibodies. Moreover, participants experienced no major side effects, the most significant reaction being mild fatigue in a small portion of patients.

Abstract

Individuals infected with HIV-1 require lifelong antiretroviral therapy, because interruption of treatment leads to rapid rebound viraemia. Here we report on a phase 1b clinical trial in which a combination of 3BNC117 and 10-1074, two potent monoclonal anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies that target independent sites on the HIV-1 envelope spike, was administered during analytical treatment interruption. Participants received three infusions of 30 mg kg−1 of each antibody at 0, 3 and 6 weeks. Infusions of the two antibodies were generally well-tolerated. The nine enrolled individuals with antibody-sensitive latent viral reservoirs maintained suppression for between 15 and more than 30 weeks (median of 21 weeks), and none developed viruses that were resistant to both antibodies. We conclude that the combination of the anti-HIV-1 monoclonal antibodies 3BNC117 and 10-1074 can maintain long-term suppression in the absence of antiretroviral therapy in individuals with antibody-sensitive viral reservoirs.",1,title post copy paste title ninth paragraph linked academic press release clinical trial new antibody therapy control hiv month treatment phase b clinical trial published nature participant stopped taking antiretroviral drug subsequently received three infusion two bnabs course six week researcher report among nine individual carried virus sensitive antibody treatment suppressed hiv average week week patient unlike individual receiving one bnab receiving combination therapy develop resistance virus sensitive antibody moreover participant experienced major side effect significant reaction mild fatigue small portion patient journal reference pilar mendoza henning gruell lilian nogueira joy pai allison l butler katrina millard clara lehmann isabelle suárez thiago oliveira julio c c lorenzi yehuda z cohen christoph wyen tim kümmerle theodora karagounis ching lan lu lisa handl cecilia unson brien roshni patel carola ruping maike schlotz maggi witmer pack irina shimeliovich gisela kremer eleonore thomas kelly e seaton jill horowitz anthony p west pamela j bjorkman georgia tomaras roy gulick nico pfeifer gerd fätkenheuer michael seaman florian klein marina caskey michel c nussenzweig combination therapy anti hiv antibody maintains viral suppression nature doi link abstract individual infected hiv require lifelong antiretroviral therapy interruption treatment lead rapid rebound viraemia report phase b clinical trial combination bnc two potent monoclonal anti hiv broadly neutralizing antibody target independent site hiv envelope spike administered analytical treatment interruption participant received three infusion mg kg antibody week infusion two antibody generally well tolerated nine enrolled individual antibody sensitive latent viral reservoir maintained suppression week median week none developed virus resistant antibody conclude combination anti hiv monoclonal antibody bnc maintain long term suppression absence antiretroviral therapy individual antibody sensitive viral reservoir,anger

">At a round-table discussion a few years ago, focused on the high failure rate for Alzheimer’s drugs, Dr. Berry was amazed to hear one drug company researcher admit to such thinking out loud. The researcher said that when he and his team designed the Phase 3 trial, he thought the drug would probably fail. But if they could get an approval for a drug for Alzheimer’s disease, it would be “a huge success.”

>“What he was saying,” marvels Dr. Berry, “was, ‘We’re playing the lottery.’ ”

>The fact that the pharmaceutical companies sponsor and run the bulk of investigative drug trials brings what Dr. Ioannidis calls a “constellation of biases” to the process. Too often, he says, trials are against “a straw-man comparator” like a placebo rather than a competing drug. So the studies don’t really help us understand which treatments for a disease work best.


Seems like we are seeing the limits of drug-driven, evidence-based medicine.

>The assumption that EBM is good science is unsound from the start. Decision science and cybernetics (the science of communication and control) highlight the disturbing consequences. EBM fosters marginally effective treatments, based on population averages rather than individual need. Its mega-trials are incapable of finding the causes of disease, even for the most diligent medical researchers, yet they swallow up research funds. Worse, EBM cannot avoid exposing patients to health risks. It is time for medical practitioners to discard EBM's tarnished gold standard, reclaim their clinical autonomy, and provide individualized treatments to patients.

"Hello, I am a 21F (4'11"", 220lbs, white) and I have been diagnosed with Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension since July of 2022 with a diagnostic opening pressure of 56mmHg. I also have a history of SVT, Gastroparesis, Binge Eating Disorder (restrict and binge cycle), and Schizoaffective Disorder. Daily, I take Acetazolamide between 375mg and 500mg, Quetiapine 12.5mg, Gabapentin 200mg, Melatonin 10mg, and a Multivitamin. I have a Mirena IUD. As needed, I take Ondansetron 4mg, Imitrex SQ, and Albuterol inhaler. 

I have tried nearly every long term option to treat my IIH and I am looking for any clinical trials in the Midwest United States or any alternative treatments. I would love to be able to bring one up to my neurologist but I am not able to see him until March. Below I have listed every treatment I have tried and why it has failed.

1. Acetazolamide- I am unable to tolerate a dose higher than what I am on now. If I am having a particularly high pressure day, I will take another 125mg in addition to my 375mg. Any more than this, I have tinnitus to the point that I can't hear anything else and I can't feel my hands or feet (which is a problem as a healthcare worker and needing to drive). 
2. Topiramate- allergic reaction (fever, rash, edema)
3. Stent- while my MRI showed bilateral transverse sinus stenosis, my angiogram in April of this year did not show stenosis.
4. VP/LP shunt- neither of the surgeons I saw recommended an LP shunt due to age and activity level and my ventricles are very narrowed, between 1.7 and 2mm in diameter, so a VP shunt would most likely fail.
5. Weight loss- this is currently my only option and while I have made some progress (down 15lbs), I have a lot working against me. My insurance will not cover anything weight related (dietician/nutritionist, weight loss medications, bariatric surgery, etc.). My SVT is exercise induced and I have a few episodes per week (210-230bpm for 3-10 minutes) and after these, I feel so exhausted for the rest of the day and can hardly get out of bed. I have been able to control my binging episodes for the most part and this is how I have been losing weight. I also have serial lumbar punctures, about once every 3 weeks at worst and every 3 months at best, which makes weight loss even harder because I can't keep a consistent routine.

Please ask any clarifying questions if need be but I am really looking for alternative treatment options or trials at this point.

They are interested in him also taking bumex during the procedure as it apparently helps.

"I am 33F, 36+3 weeks pregnant. I was happy to see the Abrysvo RSV vaccine is now approved for pregnant women up to 36 weeks. I got a prescription from my doctor and brought it into a pharmacy. I verbally confirmed with the pharm tech I would be receiving Abrysvo. She said yes. After the pharmacist administered the shot to me, I looked on his desk and saw the box said Abrexvy. 

Now, Abrexvy has not been approved in pregnant women. The current formulation (an adjuvanted version) was not ever tested in pregnant women. They had a clinical trial of an unadjuvanted version that was ended early due to possible increased risk of preterm birth. 

Anyway. I don’t know what to do. If their trial was for the unadjuvanted version, it’s possible I’m the only pregnant woman ever to receive the adjuvanted Abrexvy RSV vaccine.

2. Contact GSK (maker of Arexvy) if you have pregnancy-specific questions. There’s not much information publically available but sometimes drug reps can answer your questions or provide more info on a case-by-case basis. They also should know about you in case they get more info about this vaccine down the road that would relate to your situation. 
3. Abrysvo does also have a potential risk of preterm birth (the FDA and Pfizer are carrying out additional studies to examine what/if there is a link), but you let your OBGYN know right away and they will be the best resource for you going forward!

"Thankfully, concern about preterm birth is less concerning for, say, you than it is for someone who received the vaccine very early, for example at 30 weeks. I dived into the study; it looks like there was one extra preterm birth for every 54 mothers vaccinated, which means an individual's risk of a preterm birth is less than 2%. This is a great example of a small risk in a big population leading to the small risk being intolerable; a <2% risk times every pregnant mother is still a lot of possibly affected births.

Between that and the fact that you're fairly well along, I think things are low risk. It probably takes awhile for the vaccine to start having effect anyways; presumably its effect of causing a preterm birth is not immediate (the immune system may take weeks to complete an immune response). Obviously let everyone involved (OBGYN as you did, neonatologist/pediatrician) know.

At some point this should get reported to the higher-ups at the company who gave you your vaccine, but that can come later.

"I think you have gotten some really great responses but I just wanted to add that with the RSV vaccines and the preterm birth thing the picture is really complex; I work in vaccine immunology (not for any pharmaceutical company) and have been chatting recently with some experts in reproductive immunology who are looking at this issue closely and \*warning, hypothesis without hard data to support it yet\* they think that the preterm birth thing is not directly the fault of the vaccine, but rather an interaction between the vaccine and some environmental factor that is limited to lower and middle income countries.GSK did indeed have to stop their trial of their unadjuvanted version of Arexvy (meaning it has only the RSV PreF3 protein and no AS01 to enhance the immune response, making it very similar to Pfizer's approved vaccine which is also just 2 subtypes of the RSV F protein with no adjuvant) because of extreme cases of preterm birth. However, when you look at where this is happening across trial sites, the results are very inconsistent across regions. In general, it is only in lower and middle income countries that you see this imbalance, and there is also an unusual time lag between the vaccination and the preterm births if it were something that were directly attributable to the vaccine. In the case of Pfizer's vaccine, most of the study participants came from the US and when you look there, the imbalance in preterm births is a lot more subtle, and when you limit it to people who got the vaccine at 32-36 weeks, the placebo group actually has a slightly higher risk of preterm birth numerically (this difference is probably not meaningful i.e., I doubt the vaccines are protecting against preterm birth when you give them later).The ACIP's slides on this are really informative if you would like to look at them:

[https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/slides-2023-09-22.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/slides-2023-09-22.html)

Specifically, the EtR slides 20-33 deal with this whole preterm birth question and make it clear why they recommended going at 32-36 weeks for vaccination:

[https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2023-09-22/06-Mat-Peds-Fleming-Dutra-508.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2023-09-22/06-Mat-Peds-Fleming-Dutra-508.pdf)

Anyway, given that you are already at 36 weeks, the chance that anything bad happens here is \*very\* low, but do be vigilant if anything seems off to you, and don't forget about nirsevimab. 

RSV is a really serious virus for babies (especially premature babies) and older adults, and for the first time in history we have effective ways to prevent severe RSV. I am really glad that you are taking that seriously to protect your child and I wish you didn't have to deal with the stress that this error caused.

But I guess I’m wondering why they only trialed the unadjuvanted formula in pregnancy and not the adjuvanted formula that’s on the market now. Is there a reason they might not have wanted their proprietary adjuvant in a pregnancy vaccine?

"In addition to reporting to VAERS, this could be prevented by software safeguards. If this was at a chain pharmacy, this should be escalated to their corporate QA team.

"Great questions! Let me see if I can help you out (apologies for length).

Vaccination against RSV is a bit of a unique situation. To get any kind of immune response, you need to first activate the innate immune system (a network of nonspecific defenses that recognize the presence of danger or infection) and then the adaptive immune system (the part of the immune system we generally think of as having memory and the part we mostly group with antibodies). The innate immune system however does not have sensors for specific structures (in the way that an antibody or T cell receptor might recognize only one part of one protein that exists)- instead, the innate immune system works by using pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). These are proteins that recognize conserved structures that are present on entire groups of microbes that cause disease, and depending on which one you trigger you can get a different type of response. For example, bacteria (specifically bacteria that don't stain purple on a Gram stain) all have a substance in their cell wall called lipopolysaccharide (LPS) which is recognized by a protein called toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). When TLR4 senses LPS, it initiates a cascade of inflammation that tells the immune system ""this is threatening! We should mobilize against it!"" and only after that do you get antibody responses and T cell responses. By only responding to antigens when there is appropriate context, the immune system avoids inadvertently targeting your own cells and causing autoimmune disease. Something like the F protein of RSV or the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 by itself cannot trigger these pattern recognition receptors because they are too specific (in immunology jargon we would say that these things are not MAMPs- microbe-associated molecular patterns).

Generally, the point of adding adjuvants to vaccines is to trigger the innate immune system to recognize something as threatening or to make something that already looks threatening look even more threatening. This is a surefire way to get great immune responses- but unfortunately activating your immune system is a surefire way to make you feel like crap. All those flu-like symptoms you get when you're sick- that's your immune system (and mainly your innate immune system at that), and that's why you're feeling all that you're feeling now after Arexvy.

But there is an exception. When you have memory cells (memory B cells and memory T cells), it turns out you no longer need to trigger the innate immune system because you have already licensed those memory B and T cells (i.e., you made them before and they respond to something your immune system knows is threatening, so it doesn't need the whole two-factor authentication approach- they can just go). That's really key because a lot of microbes replicate very quickly, so the less time you waste trying to clear them, the more likely you are to have a good outcome. So, when your memory B cells recognize an antigen they are specific to, that is enough to initiate a huge antibody response. Because we are reinfected by RSV throughout our lifetimes, we have a lot of memory cells against it, so just giving the RSV F protein (the fusion protein- this is like the spike protein for SARS-CoV-2 or the hemagglutinin protein for flu) is enough to give a big response. The piece here that's a bit tricky is that the RSV F protein is a really difficult target normally. You see, RSV's F protein is really unstable and it shifts between two shapes very rapidly, and this is a problem because the position of the RSV F protein that enables antibodies to most potently block infection (formally we say that they are specific to the prefusion conformation) is present only for a limited amount of time. This in turn means that it is \*extremely\* difficult to get high levels of infection-blocking antibodies through RSV infection, and in fact, there are human challenge studies where healthy adults who get over an RSV infection are challenged with a lab strain of the virus (which causes less severe disease) and in some cases they can be reinfected by this strain every 2 months as often as 4 times. The good news is: the infections progressively get much milder as you accumulate immunity, even becoming asymptomatic as we age. When we initially identified RSV, we realized very quickly that this was a microbe that caused a lot of illness and we immediately tried to make a vaccine against it in the 1960s, but that ended very badly because the vaccine used virus that was inactivated using formalin (a dilute solution of formaldhyde). Formalin is used to inactivate viruses all the time and it's the reason that tetanus and diphtheria vaccines work and don't cause tetanus or diptheria (only trace amounts of formaldehyde are actually present in any vaccine because it gets purified out- the concentration of formaldehyde in an infant's blood from their own body's metabolism is much higher than anything in a vaccine). Formalin works like molecular glue- it locks proteins into a particular position, in this case the postfusion conformation, which made the kids who got it basically unable to respond to the prefusion conformation and actually made disease worse (this is known as vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease, or VAERD). It was not until 2013 that we figured out how to stabilize the RSV F protein in its prefusion conformation (this classic paper describes the first time we achieved that and how: [https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.1126/science.1243283](https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.1126/science.1243283)) and that it turns out makes all the difference. These vaccines give much higher antibody levels against the F protein than what can reasonably be achieved by infection because they allow the immune system to sample the RSV F protein at sites Ø and V much more easily than what is possible in infection.

"So, why bother with an adjuvant in the first place? Pfizer decided not to after testing it: [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2106062](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2106062)

They in fact tried to use adjuvants and found that using alum (which is the most popular and common adjuvant for vaccines because it is so nontoxic and well-tolerated) reduced the amount of antibody transferred to the baby and didn't really seem to help the antibody response. This is probably because the antibody response in pregnant people relies almost completely on memory cells regardless of what you do, so an adjuvant doesn't offer much of a push to help, and because different types of antibodies are not all transferred equally well. In particular, one antibody subclass, IgG2, is more effectively induced by alum+RSV F protein than the RSV F protein alone but has the lowest efficiency of antibody transfer across the placenta of all the IgG subclasses (if you want to get really nerdy about it, the hierarchy is IgG1 > IgG4 > IgG3 > IgG2- different classes of antibodies have different functions and are produced in response to different types of threats). Because this vaccine is mainly about protecting babies rather than pregnant people (unlike COVID and flu, RSV isn't really a major concern illness-wise for pregnancy), you really want to transfer over as much antibody as possible here, and if you aren't managing that with more agitation of the immune system all you're doing with that is making the vaccine more reactogenic ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactogenicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactogenicity)). The more antibody you transfer, the longer it will take before those antibodies drop below protective levels (with some asterisks). I would guess that GSK didn't bother with an adjuvant for pregnancy because pregnant people can respond just fine without needing one. People often describe pregnancy as an immunosuppressed state but this is an outdated viewpoint. The immune system in pregnancy definitely undergoes major changes to avoid rejecting the fetus (in the way you might reject an organ), but we have a lot of data showing that immune responses to vaccines given in pregnancy tend to be comparable to those of matched nonpregnant individuals e.g.:[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455389/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455389/)

So- why AS01? AS01 is different (and GSK owns it which means Pfizer can't use it). AS01 is the same adjuvant used in the Shingrix vaccine for shingles ([https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/shingles/hcp/shingrix/recommendations.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/shingles/hcp/shingrix/recommendations.html)). You may have older people in your life who have had it who know they should probably plan to get it when they can rest for a few days. It contains a detoxified form of LPS called monophosphoryl lipid A and a compound from the soap bark tree called QS-21 (this is the adjuvant used in Novavax's COVID vaccine if you've heard of that) presented together on a fat bubble called a liposome. While alum tends to give your immune system a response that we generally associate with control of parasites or bacteria that live outside cells, AS01 gives a distinctly antiviral signature. The major reason AS01 is added to vaccines is actually not for the antibodies but for the T cell response, which is particularly important as people age because T cell function drastically declines with age. Arexvy is actually intended for older adults- people aged at least 60. That's the major reason it's included in the RSV vaccine for them. With RSV there's actually additional data that suggests that while antibodies are really important for younger people, in older adults protection is more dependent on T cells, so it's a good move and it's well supported by the incredible success of Shingrix. AS01 is also currently a hot area of research in several areas of immunology because there is evidence that it can help give nonspecific protection against microbes that aren't targeted by the vaccine. For example, one study found that people who received Shingrix had a 32% lower chance of getting hospitalized from COVID-19:[https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/225/11/1915/6486498](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/225/11/1915/6486498)

This could be coincidental because people weren't randomized to receive Shingrix or placebo, this is working off people's medical records, and people who get Shingrix might differ in ways from people who didn't in ways we don't understand but there are mechanisms we know of by which AS01 may offer nonspecific protection, so it is being looked into.

So, even though I'm sure the way you feel right now really sucks (I expect your arm is very sore and red), there's a chance that you're getting some bonus protection right now to microbes other than RSV (but we don't know for sure), if that's any consolation.

"No no! That was the alum. Alum results in less transferred antibody than no alum because alum makes more of the RSV antibodies IgG2 and IgG2 has a harder time crossing the placenta than other antibody subclasses. I don’t know that we have data on AS01’s effect in pregnancy but I would expect AS01 to mainly give IgG1 and IgG3 which should get across the placenta very easily. The AS01 is likely giving a big bonus to your T cells but whether that means anything for your baby isn’t obvious. Maternal antibodies across the placenta are really the key for protection with infectious diseases for baby.
The vaccine should also induce antibodies in your breastmilk and your breastmilk will also have all sorts of immune cells (including T cells) which in theory might play a role in helping protect your baby but I will say that the evidence that breastmilk is protective against infections that don’t occur in the GI tract is pretty weak. 

I should mention: I think there is a lot of undue pressure on new parents to breastfeed and it just doesn’t match the level of evidence. There’s strong evidence it’s protective against GI infections, and it may reduce the risk of allergies, but as for the rest… a lot less clear. Most of the protection your baby gets immunologically is going to come from the pregnancy through the antibodies you transfer across the placenta. Breastfeeding is a great way to meet your child’s nutritional needs but it’s not always the best option for everyone and people don’t deserve to feel shamed for it. In high income countries where there’s clean water and formula, that is totally fine to use if you feel like breastfeeding isn’t the best option for you.

"I signed up for the Johnson & Johnson clinical trial in mid December. I believe I was one of the last people in America to participate in the trial. When I first called they gave me an appointment, then the next day I got a call saying that it was cancelled as the study was full. Then later that day, I got a call saying that Johnson and Johnson changed their mind and wanted like 100 more people and I was one of them if I wanted.

Anyway, I had a little muscle pain in my arm where I got the shot and felt a little sick the next day (like a mild cold maybe) which leads me to believe I got the vaccine instead of the placebo. Still I know this could have been a coincidence or just in my head, so I think I should proceed as if I haven't been vaccinated. Especially since we don't know how effective that vaccine is yet.

The paperwork they gave me says I can't get a covid vaccine while I'm part of the study. But it also says that I can drop out of the study whenever I want for any reason at no penalty (besides that they won't pay me anymore, presumably).

So I'm thinking that I may just drop out of the study when I can get vaccinated for sure. Though that may be a while as I'm 35, have no health issues besides hypertension that is controlled by medication, and work from home.

I know that there is probably no publicly available data (or perhaps any at all) about how safe it would be to get different vaccine if you've received the Johnson and Johnson one. But perhaps you could tell me if it is generally safe to get vaccinated twice for the same disease.

"Going back as far as I can remember, I've had a lot of difficulty differentiating faces. It was only a few years back when I found out this is a real medical condition: prosopagnosia. It can be caused by damage to a certain region of the brain (the fusiform face area), but a lot of people just seem to have it with no particular explanation. I'm the latter type -- no head injuries, definitely not anywhere near that area. It is (was) frustrating, awkward, and inconvenient, leaving me with social anxiety I struggled with for years (making friends is scary when you can't even remember the faces of the people closest to you); eventually I learned to manage.

Then, a few months ago, I started taking Wellbutrin for depression. Almost immediately, I realized I could quickly and easily recognize people without thinking about it, something I can't recall ever having been able to do. Interestingly, this doesn't just apply to learning people's faces; I've been recognizing people I haven't seen since substantially before I started the medication. Nothing medical has changed other than that (haven't been in an accident, struck by lightning, bit by radioactive spider, etc.).

I do know a couple other people who have this disorder, but two people doesn't make much of a sample. Wellbutrin is cheap and fairly harmless, and if it really does work to treat prosopagnosia, it might help the social issues of a lot of people with the disorder. Is there anyone I can pass this on to who might be interested in the possibility?

"Hi all. 

My general practitioner, who I've been seeing for several years and trust, also runs a clinical research center out of the same building as the doctors' offices. 

I had a virtual annual checkup today, and at the end of the call he mentioned that his clinical research center is enrolling patients for a Phase 3 trial of the Medicago COVID-19 vaccine. He said it was a viral light particle vaccine, which is a proven technology, and that the company has made vaccines before.

I think it's \[this trial\]([https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04662697](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04662697)), which is the US version of \[the Canadian trial\]([https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04636697](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04636697)). 

I plan on getting a vaccine as soon as one becomes available, and I recognize that as an otherwise healthy (save being 20 pounds overweight) 30-year-old I'm low down on the list for the already approved vaccines. However, I do have some concerns:  


1) If I get a placebo, will I wind up not getting the real vaccine as early as I would have had I not joined the clinical trial?

2) If I get the real thing, what if it's not as effective as the already approved vaccines, which I may (?) no longer be eligible for?

3) I've never of Medicago before and it doesn't look like they've every gotten a vaccine approved before. They're using a new plant-based system instead of egg-based. Should I be concerned? 

4) What else do I need to be asking, to make sure it's going to be safe and I'm not going to regret waiting for Moderna/Pfizer doses to become available.   


Many thanks!",3,hi general practitioner seeing several year trust also run clinical research center building doctor office virtual annual checkup today end call mentioned clinical research center enrolling patient phase trial medicago covid vaccine said viral light particle vaccine proven technology company made vaccine think trial u version canadian trial plan getting vaccine soon one becomes available recognize otherwise healthy save pound overweight year old low list already approved vaccine however concern get placebo wind getting real vaccine early would joined clinical trial get real thing effective already approved vaccine may longer eligible never medicago look like every gotten vaccine approved using new plant based system instead egg based concerned else need asking make sure going safe going regret waiting moderna pfizer dos become available many thanks,joy

I'm a 31 year old male who has just been diagnosed with an inguinal hernia.

I'm looking for a few options and would love some advice.

I've posted this 5 times and it keeps getting removed ive listed everything in the post that is asked

I need some medical advice on what way I should go with my cancer treatments. I currently have stage 3B follicular non Hodgkins lymphoma. It was stage 4 when it came back from remission but now it is down to stage 3b.  I am on a clinical trial through Sloan Kettering Hospital in NYC. I am in the NYC area also. I am currently out in disability and it has not been easy on my finances with this clinical trial for a 2nd time. The medical advice I'm asking for is plain & simple but not clear cut to me. I need medical advice for  help to make a decision with staying on the clinical trial or just ending treatment& going on hospice. The reason I'm coming to reddit is because I'm at my whits end & nobody in my family or friends wants me to stop treatment cause they don't want me to die obviously but they won't listen past me saying I thunk inwant to stop treatment. They flip out & say i need to be strong& fight to live bullshit along with every other bullshit thing people say to cancer patients to make them feel adequate or that they have the good fight in them once again. I think it's come to the end of the road for me though, cause of the situation I've gotten myself into with the fentanyl. I'll explain the fentanyl situation later on. Right now, currently 
I have tumors in my neck and brain stem and pther parts of my brain that are small now. All the lymph nodes on the left side neck, shoulder and underarms are full of cancer. Plus it has gone to my ribs & fractured plus broken 4 or more of them on the left side. The ribs being painful is an understatement with these ribs & its also in the lymphnodes in my left kidney & left side of my SI joint & now it's also on multiple levels of my spine area. My neuro surgeon says i need surgery asap or it will get worse and effect my walking & even standing up eventually,  but all my other Dr's won't approve me to have the surgery at this time due to the cancer being aggressive and reaching the areas it has reached so fast in so little time.  It's also has reached a small spot on my liver very recently & now also my femur bones on both side. I just think my body doesn't have it in me to fight this for a  2nd time around. On top of all that I was taken off of pain meds when I went into remission in april for about 8 weeks and had to start getting pain pills off the street to help me with pain that i was having post cancer. The whole time.i thought it was post cancer pain  it was really just the cancer coming back but  Not one dr would listen to me about my pain or tell me i was addicted to the pain meds from the tome taking them even thou i didnt take them everyday due to not wanting to get addicted to opiate and then they just cutting me off with no help at all on addiction to opiates or explaing what would happen when i ran out of pain medicine in general. They just said to take tylenol or ibprofen and lose more weight if i can. Over a short 8 week the cancer showed up on a CT scan at the er . The Dr's made me think I was in remission for good cause this cancer is rare to come back or become aggressive. So it came back fast and with a vengeance this time. Well, So,im an honest person & felt its best to be honest with all my  health care professionals no matter what it is. Well,  I was honest and told my oncologist that I was getting pain meds off the street and he said he was going to do a drug test to see what pain medicine i was getting from the street
I was told him it was oxycodone 30mg time release but of course inwas wrong.  Well it came back on my drug test as fentanyl. Well, of course as soon as he saw fentanyl come back on my drug test his whole attitude changed and he treated me like a junkie not a cancer patient. He refuses to help me in any way until.l im off of the fentanyl well,I'm currently in the withdrawl process to get off of the fentanyl &it's just making everything even more hard of course.im on day 2 of having no fentanyl and the withdrawls are worse than the damn cancer itself. I tried to get on suboxene it didn't nothing for the pain and I didn't last long in that clinic cause they said I needed to go to pain management for pain meds for the cancer. Like duh I know that but I got addicted to the fentanyl and now im stuck. So they didnt want to deal with this anymore  they made an appointment at the Methadone clinic for me. The methadone  didnt help the cancer pain at all. It just made me nod and still be in pain but i was just sleeping all the time while in constant pain and being sick non.stop with the damn cancer growing rampant in my body. Then,  The dr at the methadone clinic sat me down and said  i need to be on pain meds for the cancer & if im on methadone no dr is even gonna look at me for pain medicine cause if im on methadone. He said I really need to be in pain management or my oncologist needs to write a script for pain meds. I explained the situation he didnt believe me and he called my oncologist who told him the same exact thing I said smh. So the methadone clinic dr said the best option he could suggest is to try and kick the fentanyl cold turkey. Thats what im doing now. Im on day 2 of no fentanyl at all. Everyone I know in the medical field is shocked I'm going thru this and said to get another opinion which i have and they just agree that I can't be given pain meds while being addicted to fentanyl no duh thats insane to even thunknof on a common sense level. Nothing helps with the cancer pain at this point im just suffering from the cancer pain and the pther symptoms from havung cancer loke nauseous, fever nonnstop from the lymph nodes being full.of cancer, and the non stop dizziness and now seizures that have happend a few tomes from it being in my brain stem. Im a walking case of problems from cancer andngetting no help cause of the damn fentanyl being in my system. But not one dr i see will help me get help to get off the fentanyl by putting me in a medical induced coma to get past the physical withdrawal process or even help me get into an ibogaine treatment in canada cause of the cancer stopping any idea of doing the ibogaine treatment in canada. Im sure theybwont even look at my situation cause of the damn cancer. It's a never ending battle between the cancer and the damn fentanyl being in my system for the drug tests now it's on my medical record.  It's a never ending battle trying to get the help I need for both the cancer and the withdrawal process to be easier than cold turkey. But i said fuck it and i am im doing it cold turkey and its hell so far im on only day 2 but im trying to stay strong and get past this withdrawal process and have some meds to help but theybarent really doing shit for me. Yes I know its very stupid of me to even start buying pills from a trusted person I know and stupid to believe him that it was oxycodone cause i should of known it wasnt the same feeling as oxycodone.I agree that I need to be off fentanyl to get treated with pain meds. Well, Honestly, once im off this fentanyl for good after withdrawaling  after going cold turkey.  Should I even get any pain meds prescribed to me for a never ending circle of being addicted to opiates for the rest of my life and made to feel or look like a junkie at every dr visit or hospital stay?  Do all drs look at their patient as junkies if they are in my situation? My situation is rare but it clearly happening and i have no help or resources to help me with this rare ass situation im in now. Shit let's be honest I ask myself if I  am I a junkie now? Ive never been addicted to anything in my life so this is all new to me on this road with fuckin cancer here also.  Some of my medical professional friends and or family of mine keep saying to get a lawyer& Sue the Dr's of mine because I am not being treated fairly due to the fentanyl addiction and having cancer. I keep telling all of them I got addicted to fentanyl then the cancer came back.IMO The Dr's are doing their best that they can woth this rare situation that I created with this fentanyl and it needs to end for once and for all. i definitely am done with the fentanyl but course if im going to be looked as junkie with cancer for the rest of my life while in treatment what do i do to not look like a junkie to all drs for the rest of my life if i beat cancer or not!  Part of me wants to throw in the towel and be done and the other wants to fight until I have no more fight in me. Right now I don't feel I have left fight left and I'm so desperate im.putting my situation on reddit to hopefully get advice. I talked to one of  my visiting nurses about this situation im in and told me if i stop my treatments and go on hospice they will be in charge of pain medicine & will give me any pain medicine with no problem cause i stopped treatment and now choose death. Like WTF im afraid of one thing only and that is death or dying. Why would she even say that to me even if i asled her advice. It is probably cause im addicted to fentanyl and she views me as a jinkie now too. Life ending is scary for me cause of the unknown after death.  I know its part of life but it scares the hell out of me but I'm at a point where I'm ready to accept death if thats the path meant to go down at this time. I feel the clinical trial just wants my case for their advantage in curing cancers cause it worked on me the 1st time around & of course my money to pay for the clinical trial to be given to me. So, me asking them for advice on what to do is pointless and absurd because I'm the star project  patient in the clinical trial that the clinical trial has worked on the 1st time that I beat this cancer. I have asked them and they just say the same think to stay positive and fight this battle again. While Im lost& confused and feeling neglected at the moment by everyone around me whether its medically, professionally and or loved ones so i turned to reddit for some help or guidance from a medical professional viewpoint. Also in America we do not  have euthanasia laws, so i cant end my life on my own terms in America but i also feel that 20% chance is low percent to beat this cancer a 2nd time around with this clinical trial. Last time it was 80% thats a big difference in percentages. In reality It might not even work again for me. Like I said I have asked all the clinical trial Dr's and they say to have faith but in my opinion I'm a guinea pig for their clinical trial and my money is helping them fund their clinical trial to fet approved by the FDA. My oncologist told me it's my decision and if I stop treatment he will have to refer me to 100% hospice care. My primary didnt even really answer when I asked him his advice. He said it's out of his professional scope of medicine and to ask my oncologist smh. All the other Dr's I see tell me to do my own research and ask lots of question to help me make my mind up on my course of action. That is just a nice way of saying we don't want to be bothered with your decision that you have to make. Maybe coming to reddit isn't smart or logical but im currently held with my back against the wall in a situation I can't deal with from any area especially while i am on wothdrawl from that damn fentanyl. I'm just looking for a medical professional advice from how I'm being treated by all my Dr's? Am I wrong for thinking I'm being treated like a Junkie with cancer? Is it possible to go thru withdrawal get on pain medicine again and to be able to get off it again if I beat caner for a 2nd time? Is 20% a low percentage to beat this cancer again? If it is low that would you tell you patient in my situation? Or what would you tell a loved one? Will I always be labeled as a junkie because of the fentanyl being on my chart? What would you do in my situation atop treatment all together or continue to have fight and fight this battle with that alim 20% chance of it actually putting the cancer in remission a 2nd time? I understand completely if you don't want to offer advice on this rare situation but what does it hurt to try and get advise from medical professionals on reddit who have no ties to my medical Dr's or medical journey..please if you have any questions I can answer anything. I have access to all.my medical charts with all the areas I'm currently being treated for. I do go for a PET scan next week cause of a suspicious area seen on 2 other places. Thats why I feel that clinical trial has stopped working everytime I go to get tealsting done more spots of cancer show up in different places all over my body. Once they told me the pain in my side was fractured and broken ribs from the cancer is when I started to give up on everything. Plus my mental health is stranded on a highway somewhere waiting for a ride back to me. Thank you for reading this long ass post. I tried to fit everything in as best as I can.

I have been taking fish oil every day for several months. I read an article recently and I really wish I could find it again, it was linked to evidence from a clinical trial but it basically said that fish oil may be detrimental to healthy people who have no pre existing heart conditions, specifically younger females. They were saying that it may actually be bad for your heart if you fall into that category (which I do.) 

So now I'm confused and a bit worried because I don't want to be taking them if that is the case. Does anyone have any insight on this? Any links?

"I deal with a lot of cancers, not by choice. It sucks and it is emotionally very taxing. However it does help put life and priorities into perspective. Stage 4 cancer was never curable to begin with. Eventually your wife or anyone else at this stage would succumb to the disease. The question was always when. There was nothing more that you or anyone else could have done. Clinical trials aren't some magical miracle cure either like in the movies. It's a study of desperation and sacrifice in hopes that something will be better than what we have. However, if anything they fail more than known treatments. You are also not letting her die. She was dying the moment she was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and even before that. What you did was buy her time, hopefully very meaningful time for both of you.

"Hi OP, I am really sorry for what you and your wife are going through. I just want to share my experience as a fellow stage 4 NSCLC patient (39F) who was also diagnosed 2 years ago.



In March 2023, I was declared terminal: I had already consumed platinum chemo and immunotherapy options so I had to start another chemo (pemetrexed). But I was down to 90 pounds (normally was around 115 pounds) , had lost all that weight in just 2 months along with cancer progression and was feeling very weak. So I made the decision to not start chemo that time and my oncologist agreed saying that it would do more harm than good. And she offered SBRT for local symptom control so I had radiation treatment (for the second time to the same big tumor). 3 months after SBRT, I was already gaining weight, feeling more energy & less pain along with tumor shrinkage. In the meantime, despite not having any systematic treatment, I didn't (and still haven't) developed new metastasis. And finally I had a surgery for the removal of the metastasis so I am NED for the past 2 months. What I did was risky but I honestly believe that if I had started chemo in that condition, I might not have gotten this lucky. 



So what I want to ask you is, have they considered SBRT to at least locally control the situation and manage the symptoms? Also, have they done any repeat mutation / biomarker testing after progression? Maybe there are new mutations that could be targeted? Also, could you get a second opinion easily? It could be a very good idea. And in the meantime, are they helping her with appetite and weight problems? For e.g., I was offered steroids to increase appeatite but steroids upset my stomach and make me very wired emotionally so instead I started eating cannabis cookies and they helped greatly with appetite. Actually they are the reason I could start eating decently. I was also prescribed protein drinks which were helpful to provide a steady amount of proteins daily (protein intake is crucial in our situation!). 

  
I really hope the best for you two, good luck and a big hug. ",3,hi op really sorry wife going want share experience fellow stage nsclc patient f also diagnosed year ago march declared terminal already consumed platinum chemo immunotherapy option start another chemo pemetrexed pound normally around pound lost weight month along cancer progression feeling weak made decision start chemo time oncologist agreed saying would harm good offered sbrt local symptom control radiation treatment second time big tumor month sbrt already gaining weight feeling energy le pain along tumor shrinkage meantime despite systematic treatment still developed new metastasis finally surgery removal metastasis ned past month risky honestly believe started chemo condition might gotten lucky want ask considered sbrt least locally control situation manage symptom also done repeat mutation biomarker testing progression maybe new mutation could targeted also could get second opinion easily could good idea meantime helping appetite weight problem e g offered steroid increase appeatite steroid upset stomach make wired emotionally instead started eating cannabis cooky helped greatly appetite actually reason could start eating decently also prescribed protein drink helpful provide steady amount protein daily protein intake crucial situation really hope best two good luck big hug,sadness

"Hello everyone,  
I'm reaching out to this community in hopes of gaining some insight and advice regarding my mum's ongoing battle with ovarian cancer. It's been a challenging journey, and we're at a crossroads, considering whether to pursue further treatment in the United States or continue in Europe, specifically Italy.  
Here's a brief overview of her situation:  
\- 61 years old

\- Female

\-Not overweight 

  
\- Diagnosed with stage 3C ovarian cancer.  
\- Underwent surgery followed by platinum-based chemotherapy.  
\- Developed chemoresistance to the initial treatment.  
\- Participated in a clinical trial targeting platinum-resistant cases with nab-paclitaxel.  
\- After six months, she was excluded from the trial due to non-responsiveness.  
\- Currently starting a new treatment regimen with gemcitabine (single agent).  
Given these developments, we're inevitably pondering if exploring treatment options in the U.S. might provide her with more advanced or different therapeutic opportunities. We're specifically looking at renowned centers such as Memorial Sloan Kettering, Mayo Clinic, and MD Anderson, known for their innovative approaches and comprehensive care in oncology.  
I would deeply appreciate any insights, experiences, or advice from those who have navigated similar decisions, especially in relation to these institutions or the general landscape of ovarian cancer treatment in the U.S. vs. Italy/Europe. Our primary goal is to ensure we're doing everything possible to fight this disease while considering the quality of life, access to cutting-edge treatments, and the logistical aspects of such a significant decision.

"5 years old, male. doesn't take any medications. No other medical problems. 

Full disclosure. I am a physician (EM/IM) and my son is 5 yo. We have been evaluating for language delays, poor social skills, and extreme difficulty with attention. A year ago he got evaluated and they said he could have ASD but would need to evaluate again when older to rule out ADHD.
  

  
Honestly, he does fit the picture of ADHD a lot better than he does ASD. So comes to this year where he is 5, almost 6 and getting his reevaluation. He is clearly ADHD with a bit of language processing disorder. I agree 100% with the assessment. But when talking about the ""What's next"" plan, the psychologist seemed to be pushing something called Neurofeedback. She says they connect kids to EEGs and play random videos that stimulate parts of their brain. I know I am not keeping up with the latest and greatest in psychiatry, but this just sounded like a way for clinics to bill ""procedures"" for kids watching videos twice a week. I am happy to take the time to do this, but honestly a part of me says his going to music class or playing a sport would help him build skills for focus more than watching some video.
  

  
So... I've been trying to go into clinical trials to determine if this is a scam. For every article I found that supported it ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29445867/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29445867/) ) with HUGE conflict of interest (yikes)... I could find two articles that find no sufficient evidence ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30464474/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30464474/) , [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27238063/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27238063/) )
  

  
I see some articles saying NF has improvement when added with medication when compared to meds alone, but I don't see any randomized control trials that control for NF (like a sham NF where they go in and look at nonsense instead). I'm going in as with an IM brain and maybe there is something I am missing here. So I am coming to this community looking for other doctors to tell me is this a scam or not? Thank you.

It’s difficult to give specific advice without knowing specifically what this “blood clot” is. It could mean several different things, all of which would have preferred terms used to describe them as medical professionals.

- Does it mean a recent stroke? (“acute infarct”)

- Does it mean a stroke that happened years ago? (“old infarct”)

- Does it mean narrowing of the small vessels of the brain? (“chronic small vessel ischaemia”)

- Does it mean narrowing of one of the big vessels in the Circle of Willis? (for example, “middle cerebral artery stenosis”)

- Does it mean a bleed that has clotted? (“intracranial haemorrhage”)

These would all be things that may reasonably be described in layman’s terms as a “blood clot”, but their significance and resulting advice depends hugely on what the specific actual medical diagnosis is. This is likely only determinable from the actual wording of the MRI report (correlated with the clinical picture). I’ve put examples of potential report wording in the brackets next to each pathology above.",3,sorry dad unwell difficult give specific advice without knowing specifically blood clot could mean several different thing would preferred term used describe medical professional mean recent stroke acute infarct mean stroke happened year ago old infarct mean narrowing small vessel brain chronic small vessel ischaemia mean narrowing one big vessel circle willis example middle cerebral artery stenosis mean bleed clotted intracranial haemorrhage would thing may reasonably described layman term blood clot significance resulting advice depends hugely specific actual medical diagnosis likely determinable actual wording mri report correlated clinical picture put example potential report wording bracket next pathology,sadness
"I’m 39/f 5’6” 120. Zoladex, exemestane, asthma medications. 

Breast cancer at age 36 (DCIS with microinvasion) bilateral mastectomies, no hormone therapy (per guidance from Dana Farber, since I was trying to get pregnant and expected benefit was very small)

Chest wall recurrence at age 38 (two 5mm tumors) treated with surgery, 6 weeks radiation, now ovarian suppression + AI. Oncotype not done with initial diagnosis, but 19 with recurrence. Small tumors and no node involvement both times. No chemo.

I’m located in the South and got second opinions after both my initial diagnosis and recurrence at Dana Farber. 

The DF doctor I saw after my initial diagnosis disagreed with my local doctor, who wanted me on Tamoxifen. 

However, the DF doctor I saw after my recurrence agreed with my local Dr.‘s treatment plan for this recurrence. 

Locally, my doctor says there are no clinical trials for me because I don’t fit the clinical definition of high risk (e.g, tumor size, lymph node involvement) and that we’re being aggressive with the hormone therapy, which is what the current research recommends. 

All this to ask, should I travel to MD Anderson to get another opinion about clinical trials or really anything to reduce my risk? I have a young daughter so I’m also thinking about furthering research for her.

I barely drink(about 3 times a year), I don't do drugs(or smoke), I also drink plenty of water and work out. I've limited my sugar intake for working out as well.

"I’m (27 f) emotionally going through the ringer here. My mom (61 f) who has been battling stage 4 breast cancer since 2015, was told 4 weeks ago her liver wasn’t responding to the chemo and the tumors were increasingly growing. They quickly changed to a new chemo in hopes that it responds well to the liver tumors- but no luck. The bilirubin numbers were high, starting at 2.1, then 4.9 a a week later, and a 11.2 the following week. I was told there is nothing else we can do. No more chemo, no radiation. Her liver is failing. I asked about clinical trials, liver transplant, and immunotherapy- all which I was told she doesn’t qualify for due to the Mets spread to her bones, lungs and brain as well. She had brain surgery a year ago to remove a tumor and was told she had leptomeningeal disease. But that improved with intrathecal injections + cyber knife radiation.  

Hospice was the only option other than taking her home regularly with a home health aide. Which was not enough support in my opinion with her current state. I chose hospice after hearing the recommendation of two oncologists (including her regular oncologist) and 3 ER doctors. I feel guilty for choosing this option. She’s at home and for the past 3 days now she’s been mostly asleep. Barely speaking. I’m so scared. Every time I give her morphine I feel immense guilt. I’m only 27, this is a a lot.

"29F, 180 lbs, caucasian. Without disclosing identifying personal information, I have a congenital disease and will be on steroids for my entire life to treat it. Over a year ago, I underwent gene therapy as part of a clinical trial using the AAV5 vector. In the 9 months after the gene therapy, I was on and off tacrolimus and experienced a big decline in energy. I had bloodwork done and was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. 

I didn't respond to oral iron supplements so my pcp sent me to gastro. I had a colonoscopy, endoscopy, and capsule endoscopy but nothing was found to explain the iron loss (I take continuous birth control and don't get a period).

PCP then sent me to hematology, who gave me three iron infusions. They helped, but iron is still relatively low and pcp thinks there is something else going on (she suspects malabsorption. I was tested for celiac to rule that out)

It's been a year of doctor appointments and unanswered questions but also some very big medical bills. The gene therapy trial is claiming that iron deficiency is totally unrelated to the trial. But I have gotten iron labs prior to the gene therapy and everything was normal. The timing seems very suspicious since all these issues started in the months following gene therapy. 

Can anyone think of a reason that gene therapy, tacrolimus, or even the stress to the body caused by gene therapy could trigger iron deficiency anemia? Or could gene therapy trigger something else that could cause iron deficiency? 

The trial has been very dismissive of all of this so any help from this community would be very appreciated!

"My father (44/m) passed away a long time ago and when originally contacted by the examiner his belief was that it was it was cardiac arrest. 

My father had mental illness (schizophrenia) and was taking a trial antipsychotic drug. The drug also made him gain about 100lbs (he was 265 lbs the time of his passing). 

It wasn’t until recently that I obtained a copy of his death certificate which did not show cardiac arrest but death resulting from acute and chronic opiate abuse. My father had a history of substance abuse (H) when younger but had, as far as I understood, been clean for over 10 years, further supported by his social worker and manager of his adult home residency which required sobriety, and 2x weekly checkins with a case worker.

The Final Diagnoses of the report page listed many factors:

I. Severe mental illness on medications
   A) past suicide attempts 
   B) acute opiate intoxication 
       1) toxicology: opiates 0.5 mg/L****
        2)toxicology: free morphine 0.2 mg/L
       3) pulmonary edema and congestion
   C) clinical trial for anti-psychotic drug (redacting)

II. Chronic alcoholism (he was actually never known to drink and social workers and building managers attested to this. Only alcohol found in residence was a single bottle which investigators described as “dusty”)

III. Chronic hepatitis C

V. Stab wounds of torso (from prior random assault)

VI Arteriolar Nephrosclerosis, slight

(Point IV is not included in report. Possible typo?)

Are all these listed to note his medical history or are they all considered attributable factors to his death?

There is also no direct explanation as to opiates/narcotics being found in his residence, how often he was reported to be abusing in present history or past) or how the amount found in his toxicology would lead to his death. I spoke with him three hours prior to his passing and he was completely lucid sounding. In fact, that entire week he sounded well, despite a medical history of hearing voices. He said the trial drugs were helping with that and it had been many months/year since hearing them. The last conversation I had with him was as that of a person who had clear thoughts and was very much aware of what was going on in reality. So the classification on his death certificate is very surprising given the lack of evidence and no signs of ongoing substance abuse, possession, and frequent monitoring by case workers and management.

So questions:
Is the amount reflected (opiates 0.5 mg/L and free morphine 0.2 mg/L) enough for an overdose in an otherwise healthy person? 
Sick person? 
What is “free morphine”?
What would be classified as opiates? 
Are 0.2mg of free morphine part of the 0.5 opiates or is it a separate substance?
And, perhaps not as likely, are toxicology samples ever mixed or switched erroneously?

Thank you for your help.

"Male 38, 6'2"", 217 lbs, white.

I'm currently dealing with chronic venous insufficiency. My case is not that bad anymore, but it's my understanding this will progress, and sealing off veins early prevents progression. I've had this for about two years with improvements from weight loss, and nerves healing after the initial swelling event.

I had a bunch of vein surgeons warn me about not going to the vein clinics. I looked into them, and the vein clinics have less qualified doctors providing the treatments. I believe a US vein clinic is more likely to cause complications since it's not vascular surgeons working there. The American Society for Vascular Surgery's standard of care is conservative treatment. However, I looked up the European Society of Vascular Surgery, and their standard of care is early intervention. My grandma had this same issue, and she kept complaining about the doctors telling her to just put her feet up, until eventually decades later she had leg veins stripped.

In Europe they're even inventing newer less invasive means of sealing veins. If I go to a high quality European Clinic I believe I'm most likely to get my surface veins sealed, and stop the slight swelling in my legs in the process.  There are multiple European countries offering Sonovein, which uses sound waves to seal veins. In the US I would need to qualify for a clinical trial, and my symptoms are not severe enough to qualify. I'm most likely having to pay more for treatment or wait a couple years.

Since, the European medical system is quite large are there any services that help patients narrow down clinic selection to a more manageable range?",1,male lb white currently dealing chronic venous insufficiency case bad anymore understanding progress sealing vein early prevents progression two year improvement weight loss nerve healing initial swelling event bunch vein surgeon warn going vein clinic looked vein clinic le qualified doctor providing treatment believe u vein clinic likely cause complication since vascular surgeon working american society vascular surgery standard care conservative treatment however looked european society vascular surgery standard care early intervention grandma issue kept complaining doctor telling put foot eventually decade later leg vein stripped europe even inventing newer le invasive mean sealing vein go high quality european clinic believe likely get surface vein sealed stop slight swelling leg process multiple european country offering sonovein us sound wave seal vein u would need qualify clinical trial symptom severe enough qualify likely pay treatment wait couple year since european medical system quite large service help patient narrow clinic selection manageable range,anger

"Hello

My mother is battling platinum resistant ovarian cancer. She was on MIRASOL clinical trial, where she was showing great progress for about 4 months. Her CT scan from 6 weeks ago showed overall decrease in tumors, from 3cm to 1.1cm.  However, the recent scan revealed her cancer has regressed with additional tumor on her kidney, peritoneal thickening, and ascites. 

I can't believe this...even her blood work from 3 weeks ago showed no change in CA125 and the rest of the bloodwork compared to 6 weeks ago. Its unimaginable to think cancer can progress this fast within 3 weeks, and as hard as I try to stay calm, I'm shit scared. 

We were given choices between combining bevacizumab(avastib) with paxlitaxel or Caelyx(liposomal doxorubicin). The doctor assured either will he a good option, with paxlitaxel having slightly higher statistical success. We ultimately went with avastin+caelyx combination. 

After some research I learned avastin promotes anti-angiogenesis by inhibiting VEFG-A. My mother has been very active, and does moderate walking for about 1.5 hour everyday. I am now worried, with my limited medical knowledge, her exercise routine might promote angiogenesis which is opposite of what the drug is designed to target. 

Would it be beneficial to limit her exercise for the time being? Would moderate cardio and weights decrease the drug function? 

Thank you for reading.

"My daughter, 16 (f) 5’10” 125 lbs is in a clinical trial for PXT 3003 (combo of baclofen, naltrexone, and sorbitol for treatment for CMT 1A). She’s also on 30 mg Adderall for ADHD. Otherwise in excellent health. 

As part of the clinical trial they do labs, ua, and evaluation once a quarter. She’s had 2 quarterly follow ups so far, and in both cases her ua came back with bacteria present indicating possible UTI, most recently, it also showed high levels of CA oxalate crystals and I was told this may be a risk factor for kidney stones. They send copies of all labs to her pediatrician. After the first alert, I spoke with my daughter, who confirmed she has no symptoms of uti at all, and spoke with her pediatrician. We agreed since she’s asymptomatic it wasn’t worth treating (why take abx if you don’t need them, right?).  This time, I asked my daughter again about symptoms and she confirmed she feels completely fine.  I did suggest she needs to drink more water during the day. She also avoids using the bathroom at school so she doesn’t pee at all between 7am and 2:30pm. I’m wondering if withholding is somehow contributing to any possible issues? Anyway, her well child check will be in 2 months. Do I need to call pediatrician again and possibly have her seen sooner or can we wait until her next visit? If she was symptomatic I would take her in immediately, but these are incidental findings only because of the study protocols.

"31 AFAB (intersex)

118lb

4'11""

Caucasian

Complaint: urethral burning, 3.5 years

Super B complex, vit D+K, iron daily

Never drink, smoke, or do drugs

Hey all! I had consistent problems years ago with extremely painful urination and a burning sensation in the urethra at all times (while sitting, lying down, etc). It felt like I had a severe UTI all day every day. I saw multiple urology specialists and even participated in clinical trials to try to find anything that would work, but I never received a conclusive diagnosis. Blood tests, cystoscopy, urine cultures, etc. The only thing that could ever relieve the pain was Uribel (hyoscyamine, methenamine, methylene blue, phenyl salicylate, and sodium phosphate), and only for around 4 hours per dose. This lasted about 3.5 years.

Out of nowhere, I had a bottle of Gatorade one day. Bam -- pain gone. It took a few weeks of logging and testing things to determine that it was the Gatorade that made the difference. Ever since, I can keep the burning completely at bay by ensuring I drink at least 30 fl. oz. of Gatorade (Zero) every day. It's not a dehydration thing, because I can drink way more fl. oz. of anything else (water, soda, juice, whatever) and it will still burn. Any ideas what the Gatorade specifically is doing? My understanding is that sometimes intersex people can have problems with how much salt is concentrated in their urine, and since Gatorade is high in sodium, could that be what's happening to me?

The relief from drinking Gatorade comes within 10 minutes of having some. Just now I could feel the burning coming back, so I hit about 5 fl. oz. and it left again.",1,afab intersex lb caucasian complaint urethral burning year super b complex vit k iron daily never drink smoke drug hey consistent problem year ago extremely painful urination burning sensation urethra time sitting lying etc felt like severe uti day every day saw multiple urology specialist even participated clinical trial try find anything would work never received conclusive diagnosis blood test cystoscopy urine culture etc thing could ever relieve pain uribel hyoscyamine methenamine methylene blue phenyl salicylate sodium phosphate around hour per dose lasted year nowhere bottle gatorade one day bam pain gone took week logging testing thing determine gatorade made difference ever since keep burning completely bay ensuring drink least fl oz gatorade zero every day dehydration thing drink way fl oz anything else water soda juice whatever still burn idea gatorade specifically understanding sometimes intersex people problem much salt concentrated urine since gatorade high sodium could happening relief drinking gatorade come within minute could feel burning coming back hit fl oz left,anger

One of the exclusion criteria is ""Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled diabetes, clinically significant pneumonitis, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.""



I have premature ventricular contractions (unmedicated, monitored by my electrophysiologist), that have been as high as 20,000 in a 24 hour period (last time I did a 24 hour holter, it was around 100 per 24 hours).

Hello, I’m (36F) just wanting some info and thoughts and probably just a vent. My mum 62F, height 170cm, weight 49kg (previously 62kg when well) has terminal stage 4 oesophageal cancer, and has been battling for 3+ years. She went through an intense 2 years of chemotherapy and then when that stopped working she was placed on an immunotherapy clinical trial. She was on this for a year and just recently that had also stopped working. The doctors are now putting her on palliative radiotherapy, they wanted her to do a 10 day course. She is on day 4 and experiencing terrible pain, I guess I am just wondering what is the benefit/purpose of this? They said it will help with pain but it is actually causing her pain. 

For note, she is constantly in lots of pain and feels very sick for most of the day, everyday. When she was first diagnosed she was fitted with a feeding tube, but as there was so much cancer in the stomach it had to go into the bowel. She had many painful complications with this and it was removed about a year in. All she is able to ingest now is a coffee and 3 hospital grade protein drinks. 
During chemo her back broke twice, and was in extreme agony. Since being off chemo she seems a little stronger (at least her bones do) she can hardly walk around though and needs a walker. 

I honestly think they are just giving her options for the sake of it at this point. Her body just seems so frail and abused. I would be content with her just living/surviving for the remaining time we have but my dad keeps almost pressuring her to do more. My mum is obviously distressed as wants to do everything she can, but I can see how much pain she is in, she’s exhausted. 

I guess I am just looking for any advice, is it worth doing the full 10 days. Will it ease some pain? Or are the clasping at straws? 
Has anyone gone through this, would like to hear your stories if you want to share.

As for my problem, as I said I had blood taken for this trial, and I’ve noticed a red line coming from the site where the blood was drawn through about 3cm of my arm, running in a straight line almost parallel to my vein. I should also point out that after the blood was taken, I seemed to have bled a lot more into the plaster and slightly around the site. I know this is a lot more because I donate blood when I can and I’ve had several bouts of blood work done previously. The line is dark enough that I can see it, but faint enough that my camera can’t pick it up.

I wonder if you're having cravings and are looking for a way to satisfy these by tricking yourself that it could be good for your ADHD.

&#x200B;

> Is there any way this could be harmful? 

You're asking whether having a nicotine dependency could be harmful.

Consider that you will build up a tolerance to nicotine very quickly, it will lose a lot of its effect, and then you'll having to keep vaping or go through withdrawal effects.

There's a reason we don't prescribe nicotine in ADHD.

&#x200B;

> I think I'd rather get addicted to this than ADD drugs laced with methamphetamine. 

Many people with ADHD do not require medication.

Many medications for ADHD are not stimulants.

Amphetamine based medications are very different to someone using methamphetamine.

"As a Healthcare professional, albeit not verified on here i will do my best to phrase this accordingly so. If I've read all the data right, if I havnt someone who is more versed in studies data please correct me, the symptoms were marginally better but more people had nausea. And blood pressure increased ~10 points in both systolic and diastolic. OVER THE COURSE OF 2 DAYS. The trial was 2 days long and using patches, not vaping or smoking. Something else worth noting, people with adhd had 49% more difficulty quitting smoking than people without adhd. In short, not a very good study to base your theory off of.

Secondly, why choose to get addicted to nicotine when there's plenty of other options? Yes stimulants are one type of adhd medication but there are alot of non-stimulant medications for adhd. 

And for the vaping aspect of your statement: vape oil can have a much higher concentration of nicotine than cigarettes. I'd suggest looking up ""evali"" or ""E-cigarette- or vaping-use-associated lung injury"" and see how serious the lung injuries can get from vaping. Given that vaping is still relatively new, less than 10 years from the mainstreaming of it, there's already a specific injury name for the effects it has.

"Looking for next steps for my daughter (3, AFAB) who has hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy due to birth trauma. We were told in the NICU she would likely never walk or talk.

Otherwise she is a completely healthy child, and thankfully has no seizure activity or other complications.

I'll fly her halfway across the world if anyone can point me to the best of the best. We would also be interested in clinical trials. 

We aren't convinced that therapy is our only option. It's been very beneficial for her, but as a parent it's hard to not want to do more.

I have been diagnosed with Sensory neuropathic cough.   It started with a cold where I developed a cough about 11 years ago. First, it was a pesky throat tickle followed by the urge to cough. After having had the cough for 5 or 6 months I went to my ENT. I had had surgery about 5 years prior on vocal cord polyps and had grafts on my vocal cords.  With the continuous tickling in my throat, I had the suspicion that perhaps there was a rough edge where the surgery had happened that was causing the vibration that tickled. 

At that point I had another nasolaryngoscopy (I had at least four before surgery had been done 5 years before- where I heard from my ENT that I had one of the most sensitive gag reflexes he had ever seen in 20 years of practice). 

The nasolaryngoscopy did not see anything that could be causing the tickle. Everything looked great. 

 The ENT suggested that I could possibly have reflux because that can cause a chronic cough and put me on a 6-month course of maximum gerd medications (I can't remember at the moment what that was because it's been a while).  There was no change in cough. Did at least one acid test - the tube down my nose for 24 hours.  No acid reflux measured. 

I then went to a pulmonology specialist center in town and went through the entire gamut of testing to the evaluate for asthma, COPD, lung function.  Everything is normal. 

I don't take any of the medications that are possible triggers for chronic cough.

Year three I flew to Florida to the center for cough. Ran through all of the same tests. Another nasolaryngoscopy, asthma tests. Lung function. Everything normal. At this point I am diagnosed with sensory neuropathic cough.

So here I am. 11 years later. Still coughing. It's even worse at this point. It wakes me up at night, it's rare that I have a full night of sleep where I don't wake up coughing harshly.  At times I cough so much that it causes me to vomit. 

I have taken gabapentin, amitriptyline, Claritin, Mucinex, nasacort, singular, courses of steroids, baclofen, ryaltris, benedryl, PPIs  Sometimes it seems to help a little but not for long.  I've done stretching, yoga, meditation, I've had intercostal massage (very painful). I've run the gamut of all the lung function, tests, x-rays, scans of my nasal passage, nasolaryngoscopy.

I have participated in three clinical trials for sensory neuropathic cough- two oral medications and one trial of nerve block shots in my neck. I know for sure that I had the actual shot medication - the trial was one that once all the data was gathered, It was unblinded and if I had gotten the placebo, I would be allowed to get four rounds of actual nerve blocks, which is what happened.  No difference.  I was just recruited for a fourth trial but I just don't think I can do this one because it would require one appointment a week for 12 weeks that will require missing work. I just can't miss that much work. 

I really am trying to think of anything I can do, anywhere I can go because this chronic cough is majorly disruptive. It disrupts my sleep. It makes me wary of going places like movies, plays, and even travel.  My gynecologist is saying that she is starting to feel prolapse that she feels is being caused by the chronic cough pushing on my pelvic floor constantly.  That led to a round of pelvic floor PT.  The therapist finally said that after 6 months, the cough was just not going to let my pelvic floor do what it needed to do.

I'm on several message boards of  other cough sufferers. The only medication that any of them have ever taken that I have not is tramadol. I mentioned it to the doctor. I currently see who manages my prescriptions. He said that he can't prescribe it- I don't know if it's a personal preference or if his practice is just not able to prescribe it since it is controlled. He is mainly an allergy doctor but he ran 2 of my clinical trials. 

My husband thinks that I should try to find someone who will give me a short course of tramadol just to give it a try to see that helps at all. But as medical professionals I think you all know what would happen if I started calling around to doctor's offices asking for tramadol.

Is there anything at all you can think of that I could try? Or anywhere I could call or go? Any specialist? I'm just exhausted and desperate and want my life back

"There are many options for sleep apnea that do not include CPAP.  To be sure, PAP therapy is the option that has the best long-term outcomes, but certainly see how it's getting in the way for things with you.

Dental appliances can help move your lower jaw forward when asleep and relieve the obstruction.  These work best for people with mild sleep apnea, so may be a good option.  I would recommend to seek out a dentist who specializes in sleep apnea appliances -- it's a big money-making thing so sometimes dentists will make appliances but don't have the appropriate training.  Your doctor can help connect you with the appropriate dentists.

Alternatively the ENT docs have some options.  There are some surgeries they can do on the inside of the mouth to reduced obstruction, but that is only an option for certain people.  They can also do procedures to pull the jaw forward for people who have very posteriorly positioned jaws (retronagthia).",2,many option sleep apnea include cpap sure pap therapy option best long term outcome certainly see getting way thing dental appliance help move lower jaw forward asleep relieve obstruction work best people mild sleep apnea may good option would recommend seek dentist specializes sleep apnea appliance big money making thing sometimes dentist make appliance appropriate training doctor help connect appropriate dentist alternatively ent doc option surgery inside mouth reduced obstruction option certain people also procedure pull jaw forward people posteriorly positioned jaw retronagthia,fear

GP suggested one dose iron infusion (monoferric). I had read that low Vitamin D and low phosphate can lead to dangerous hypophosphatemia so I asked GP to check those levels. (He had never heard of those levels being an issue with infusion, but is a good and responsive doc and ordered those tests)

Vitamin D is 51.2nmol/L (""normal"" range is 75-250). (I have taken 1000IU daily for past year)

GP said he spoke with rep for monoferric and they said there is no issue. (Their website says 3.5% of people in clinical trials developed hypophosphatemia.) A rep's job is to sell the drug as effective/safe so not sure I trust them saying it's fine.  

Any hematologists or oncologists out there with insight/experience who can tell me if I should try and get my Vitamin D level up before doing infusion or if it's not a big deal?

So after spending some time at an Urgent Care, getting some scans lined up and trying to be patient, I woke up one morning to pain and compression over my chest. Urgent Care Docs had advised me that any escalation of symptoms should mean I go to the Emergency Room. Once there they almost immediately checked me into the ICU for observation and began running every test you could name. For the next 4/5 days I did just an unreal number of scans, 2 biopsies, and they drew enough blood to fill a small pool. Pain escalated daily while there so finding a solution was a running theme. So after a lot of trails here's what they found:

Current: Stage 4 Aggressive Metastatic Gastrointestinal Cancer ( Adenocarcinoma )

Previous: Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation 

After doing a Lymph Node & Bone Marrow Biopsy they found my marrow filled to capacity with dead cancer cells. This pointed them in the right direction. My platelets were crashing daily (20,000 at admission) and I've got inflamed lymph nodes throughout my chest cavity which is one source of my (significant and at time escalating) pain. Its infiltrated my lungs and several vertebrae along my spine (causing vertebrae to show signs of Osteopenia) . Weirdly enough there's no noticeable tumor/mass/lump they can trace it back to. It's kind of just spread throughout (described as Adenocarcinoma) , though they were finally able to locate a small ulcer in my stomach that allowed them to finally be able to classify it. I've currently just completed my 3rd (now weekly) round of chemo (we started asap when other options such as clinical trials were deemed a non-option) and we've been able to stabilize a number of things (blood factors such as platelets, hemoglobin and the like) along the way. Many of my blood counts are still in the trash so clinical trails are not currently an option. In early stages of my 3 weeks hospital visit I was in a state called **DIC (**Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) which caused me to act like something akin to a blood squirt gun if i bled. Essentialy it screws with you clotting factors and any bleeding event is an issue. Any procedure became an issue and many my numbers were artifically raised in order to attempt anything that would cause me to bleed. Fortunately after a week of treatments and what felt like several wheel barrows of infusions we kicked my body out of D.I.C and am more or less clotting normally. Fun story: early one morning after the vampires took their daily does of my blood a CNA came in to do a routine vitals check. This particular morning they took 2 unique sets of blood samples plus a rather large sample for testing against infectious disease. This was also kind of at the height of my ""he's not clotting"" phase. During the blood pressure check it popped open all the fresh holes in my arm, causing them to bleed and freaked/surprised the CNA. Made me laugh. (end of story).  Immunotherapy is what my Oncologist are banking on right now so crossing my fingers. Chemo is causing reasonable progress (numbers are low but stable) so we're staying the course for now. My personal mid->long term goal is to find an alternative to opiates for pain management (who the hell knows why a person tolerates opiates for a buzz cause constipation sucks!!!) so looking at alternatives (THC pills potentially or preferably resolving the issue that's causing me pain)  I've been discharged from the hospital after 3 weeks so now I'm working to find a routine that works. Losing weight so a short term goal is stopping that (I'm rather tall and (was) muscular so my bodies nuking whatever calories I put in and I'm not putting in a lot due to general nausea, but smoothies have been my friend.

"OOF. (forgot to add NAD) Welcome to the club friend. Stage 4 cancer fucking sucks but it isn't always a death sentence. I was diagnosed w/ stage 4 synovial sarcoma in 2017 (with more specific parameters that made my odds even less than stellar.. my primary site was 14.5cm at diagnosis!). Don't give up until you have to, we have more options than ever before. Support groups for your specific type of cancer (or as close as you can get to your specific subtype) are an incredible blessing and wealth of information. Infusions are great energy boosters, though, aren't they? ;) lol. I'm assuming the 2 samples were for blood cultures? It always looks like they are taking a shit ton even though they aren't. If you can get into an immunotherapy trial, DO IT. I was SO CLOSE to one but they wouldn't accept me as I was out of state with an insurance that would cover nothing. Alternatives for opiates is hard, I would go for straight up vaping medical grade marijuana if you can access it, my oncologists and palliative have both not so subtly told me ""off the record"" that they prefer that over prescribing the ""pot pill,"" and it's not acceptable in my state either, they just turn a blind eye to it. I haven't done it this round of chemo, but it was the only way I was able to deal with it the first time (I was on much harsher stuff back then, probably similar to the hell I imagine you're dealing with (was AIM plus votrient if you're wondering)). Miralax is personally my favorite to help with constipation. It's mild enough that I never get diarrhea from it and that was a big issue with other laxatives. As long as I take it every day, everything stays moving. I did a lot of slushies and milkshakes. Making smoothies with the meal replacement drinks can help a ton (I personally think the chocolate boost tastes the best and boost is leaps better than ensure). Try different brands and different flavors. The hospital nutritionists didn't care if I didn't eat as long as I had the replacement crap. I am doing instant breakfast (the powder type) this time since I can tolerate milk. If you have mouth pain asking your doctor to write you a prescription for ""magic mouthwash"" can help, but it can be hard to get it filled nowadays as most pharmacies won't mix a compounded formula. I unfortunately had severe mouth and throat swelling from it xD but the mouth pain passed for me.

I would also like to add that being a young adult dealing with this poses it's own mental challenges. I'm quite a bit younger than you are (22 when I was diagnosed), so that is probably part of the struggle I've had, but I lost my entire support network apart from family. As of right now, I only have 3 friends that I knew before I was diagnosed. The people I thought would never leave me did, and other people surprised me by how unwavering they have been. It's extremely hard not to take it personal, but some people just don't know how to deal with someone close to them going through cancer. It isn't your fault. You are allowed to grow and change as a person. It is NOT okay for people to expect you to go through this without changing at all. It's impossible not to change in some way and grow as a person imo. I was less apt to let people walk all over me afterward. I often joke that cancer stole my ability to run but gave me a spine. HA.  


If you are under-insured, and there is a teaching hospital near you, they will often cover excess costs (and usually they run the majority of clinical trials, anyway). I didn't have insurance at all when I was diagnosed and the hospital covered treatment and helped me apply for disability. The American Cancer Society has a lot of resources, but most people have local resources near them as well that others might not know about! We had a local organization give us gift cards to gas stations since I had people with time to take me, we just didn't have the gas money. There are also organizations that will help with medication costs.

Wow! Leaking blood from all your fresh holes! That’s bonkers! I’m so sorry about the diagnosis. You sound healthy otherwise and I am glad for that. Ginger and peppermint might help with nausea.,7,wow leaking blood fresh hole bonkers sorry diagnosis sound healthy otherwise glad ginger peppermint might help nausea,joy
"I'm so sorry to hear about your diagnosis, but I'm glad that so far treatment has been working.

My mom had stage 4 cervical cancer very recently so I hope that anything I suggest to you (after discussion with your medical team, as I am NAD) will help and hopefully be up-to-date.

Firstly, your weight will fluctuate as you're stabilizing. If you weigh yourself in the morning and then after a bowel movement and notice a drop, that's kinda normal especially since you're constipated from the opiates. (We figured this out as my mom was also losing weight rapidly and trying to gain it back.) Seems simple but it's one of those things you forget to think about. Also, if you haven't, invest in wet wipes over regular toilet paper. You were probably sent home from the hospital with some, but if not, get some. They're lifesavers.

Have a bunch of snacks stocked in your house. Crackers, psanut butter, summer sausage, chesse, etc.  Set up an eating schedule. It sounds weird, but you've probably been noticing that you're starting to feel hungry at around the same times every day (something like 7 am, then again at 1030 am, 130 pm, etc. etc.) Find those times that your body is consistently hungry and make it a habit or a goal, whatever you need to do, to eat *something* at those times always. Even if it's a quarter of a sandwich because that's all you could manage. Every bit counts.

Keep hydrated. My mom alternated with water and ginger ale also because of her nausea; she was also using those little 10 oz water bottles to keep track of her fluid intake, I don't know if you're needing to, but there's a suggestion if you do need to track fluid intake.

Originally I was asking about anti-nausea meds, checked the post and saw they're listed. The ginger ale tended to help her nausea (de-carbonate it almost fully first, it helps).

Another thing for calories bc that's really what you need: look into *Pedialyte*, *Ensure Plus*, and *Ensure Clear*. You said smoothies are your friend? Pedialyte and Clear are more like juice, but Ensure Plus would be something to add to your smoothies (depending on what kind you make) or to replace another liquid. 13g of protein per serving. My brother supplements with them (disabilities) and they're not bad. The only flavors of Plus that I've seen are Vanilla, Chocolate, and Strawberry. Clear is Mixed Berry or Blueberry Pomegranate (i think?) and Pedialyte has a clear/plain version, plus however many other flavors, I don't know. Mom preferred the plain.

I know this is a lot to read, and I'm sorry about that, but I hope anything here helps. And once again, IANAD, my mom had s4 cervical cancer April-July 2019. (Probably started way before, but we didnt catch it until April)

P.S. don't over-exert yourself, please. ❤",7,sorry hear diagnosis glad far treatment working mom stage cervical cancer recently hope anything suggest discussion medical team nad help hopefully date firstly weight fluctuate stabilizing weigh morning bowel movement notice drop kinda normal especially since constipated opiate figured mom also losing weight rapidly trying gain back seems simple one thing forget think also invest wet wipe regular toilet paper probably sent home hospital get lifesaver bunch snack stocked house cracker psanut butter summer sausage chesse etc set eating schedule sound weird probably noticing starting feel hungry around time every day something like pm etc etc find time body consistently hungry make habit goal whatever need eat something time always even quarter sandwich could manage every bit count keep hydrated mom alternated water ginger ale also nausea also using little oz water bottle keep track fluid intake know needing suggestion need track fluid intake originally asking anti nausea med checked post saw listed ginger ale tended help nausea de carbonate almost fully first help another thing calorie bc really need look pedialyte ensure plus ensure clear said smoothy friend pedialyte clear like juice ensure plus would something add smoothy depending kind make replace another liquid g protein per serving brother supplement disability bad flavor plus seen vanilla chocolate strawberry clear mixed berry blueberry pomegranate think pedialyte clear plain version plus however many flavor know mom preferred plain know lot read sorry hope anything help ianad mom cervical cancer april july probably started way didnt catch april p exert please,sadness

"Potential treatments and follow up questions

Hello OP,
I might see things slightly differently to others on some points purely as certain drugs (e.g. THC) are not really available in my country (England).

Whilst THC can be a useful painkiller it is also the psychoactive part of cannabis/marijuana so it's what gives the ""high"". Another part of cannabis/marijuana is CBD this would not give you a high but has been shown to be beneficial for pain and inflammation. A lot of research is still going into both but CBD has shown promising results for reducing nausea but no concrete research exists yet.

NSAIDs could be useful but as it is gastrointestinal and you have an ulcer these may not be the best idea and you would need to discuss these (as with any treatment) thoroughly.

You stated that you're on Chemo and will be starting immunotherapy soon. Both of these are very good options and immunotherapies are advancing. My question would be whether there is any plan for surgery?
It sounds like the cancer originated in your stomach by the ulcer (from your post, please correct me if I'm wrong) but that it has spread significantly to surrounding lymph nodes. There are surgeries that could be considered but these widely depend on how it has spread and your doctor/surgeon would need to look at your scans and choose the best method. Unfortunately, many of the surgeries are very aggressive with long recovery times but can provide much greater chances of survival, again this depends on your particular case and without looking at scans nobody could say this for certain.

Additionally, going back to symptom care. For nausea there are a lot of drugs that can treat/prevent vomiting but will not necessarily affect the feeling of nausea so if vomiting is an issue you could consider these. Ondansetron is quite popular for use in nausea caused by cancer treatments but many others are options.

Lastly, on the constipation side of things there are lost of different laxatives that may help but as you seem to know it tends to remain, at least somewhat, an issue. A popular laxative for use with morphine associated constipation here is docusate sodium, it causes your bowels to move more and softens the stool. Could I ask how much morphine you are on? You could also ask your doctor about something known as cross-tapering. It is used to switch from one drug (e.g. opioid) to another. In this case is would be to move from morphine to fentanyl for instance. Your doctor might consider this to see if a different opioid would give you less side effects.

Anyway. I've rattled on quite a bit now. One last thing I would say is try to still stay as active as you are able to. You obviously won't manage to be as active as before but staying active and continuing to eat as healthily as you are able is linked with a positive outcome.",6,potential treatment follow question hello op might see thing slightly differently others point purely certain drug e g thc really available country england whilst thc useful painkiller also psychoactive part cannabis marijuana give high another part cannabis marijuana cbd would give high shown beneficial pain inflammation lot research still going cbd shown promising result reducing nausea concrete research exists yet nsaid could useful gastrointestinal ulcer may best idea would need discus treatment thoroughly stated chemo starting immunotherapy soon good option immunotherapy advancing question would whether plan surgery sound like cancer originated stomach ulcer post please correct wrong spread significantly surrounding lymph node surgery could considered widely depend spread doctor surgeon would need look scan choose best method unfortunately many surgery aggressive long recovery time provide much greater chance survival depends particular case without looking scan nobody could say certain additionally going back symptom care nausea lot drug treat prevent vomiting necessarily affect feeling nausea vomiting issue could consider ondansetron quite popular use nausea caused cancer treatment many others option lastly constipation side thing lost different laxative may help seem know tends remain least somewhat issue popular laxative use morphine associated constipation docusate sodium cause bowel move softens stool could ask much morphine could also ask doctor something known cross tapering used switch one drug e g opioid another case would move morphine fentanyl instance doctor might consider see different opioid would give le side effect anyway rattled quite bit one last thing would say try still stay active able obviously manage active staying active continuing eat healthily able linked positive outcome,joy

Prednisone is the best pain reliever for me but that's because it helps the underlying problem, and I do take NSAIDs as well, but thc has been a significant part of my pain regimen too. I will warn you it doesn't actually take away pain, like almost at all, instead, it makes it easier to handle the same level of pain, which is still useful. The side effects are also much more tolerable than opiates, and it would likely help with your appetite and nausea as well. That being said, if you live in a legal or medical state, obviously you should avoid smoking, get some RSO and start off slow and low, it goes a long way. RSO is full extract but be sure to check that there is at least some CBD in there which can help avoid the anxious freakouts if you take too much.

">As to using THC, some people they help, some they don’t

Pedialyte Clear might be a good option then because as far as I am aware, it doesn't have a flavor.

"A(lpha)-pinene is one of the types of CBD that some strains of medicinal marijuana are high in. A-pinene is an anti-inflammatory. (edited to add - like it sounds, it often gives a piney smell or flavor to smokables/vapables)

https://www.siranaturals.org/sira-naturals-blog/cannabis-terpenes-alpha-pinene (this site is a good start so you understand why the next two apply to CBD/MMJ)

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24455984  (2014)

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26119957  (2015)

I find MMJ to be a strong pain reliever, however I would not want to accidentally state ""I find **THC** to be a strong pain reliever"" like I had just posted by accident, because ""THC"" is not actually interchangeable with ""MMJ"". Perhaps the poster you are replying to didnt mean to say ""THC"" but actually just meant 'medical marijuana/MMJ"". I say this because MMJ often has **NO** THC content at all, and the medicinal value is NOT in the THC (which gets you high) but rather in the CBDs (which have medicinal value).

Alternatively, opiate painkillers just make me very very dizzy and I hate them. I can still feel pain on morphine (post major surgery pain) or back when I was given stadol years ago in the hospital during a difficult childbirth during which there was no time for an epidural, or even now with vicodin for a bruised tailbone that I recently sustained, or anything in between, I just don't CARE that I'm in pain anymore with those - instead I get upset that I'm dizzy and it makes me nauseous, and it makes my head feel both very heavy and very light at the same time. 

In contrast, with MMJ the pain actually stops. For me. YMMV. IANAD. best wishes to all. ETA - I agree with the the poster who says a lot has to do with delivery method. I hate edibles (unpredictable dosing, too strong most of the time, requires chewing and swallowing food that I may or may not even want which can be an issue for me in and of itself, etc) and find pills get metabolized strangely/not as expected by otherwise experienced persons in regards to their MMJ/THC intake (haven't tried the Marinol pills or spray myself - not even sure if the spray is available outside Canada, where I believe they do have it if my old info from MS forums is still correct).

"Ya, I agree. Having a doctor can be an invaluable resource. I can only wonder how it might have changed things had I had better access. Regarding the prognosis: On paper its generally what you might think. My cancer has infiltrated my lungs/sprine/stomach/upper intestines to varying degrees, so things can go south fast. But it was a fast growing cancer that never formed any kind of tumor or mass. Scans could only ever pick of the barest of glimpses. What docs think (potentially) is that the chemo might actually be more effective on my stuff, because, while fast growing, it also means that none of the cancer is overly strong in its own right. The chemo might be able to knock it back and allow my body to catch up naturally. So my goal has been to reorganize my diet into one of those homeopathic ones to see if we cant force it into remission. Its what my mother did. She had stage 4 breast cancer, though hers presented with a large tumor. They cut it out along with some lymph nodes. Chemo/radiation for 6 months combined with a healthy diet and shes been clean for 15 years. So theres a lot up in the air right now.

I would more so worry about getting enough protein for your body to have energy to repair tissues. Chemo is super rough on the body and well, weight loss. Getting enough calories will be your goal. So sometimes that means you don't have something healthy, but something you can keep down.   
But mostly whatever your doctor recommends.  I will be hoping the chemo kicks cancer's ass for you. You are young and fit from what I've read, and your body has an excellent chance of fighting. But , and this will be hard to hear, you should make an advance directive. I had to last year going in for a major surgery.

"Not surreal. Just lack of options. Haha. We all have our own reasons but for me at least experiences in the past and what I know about those around me even today tell me if I have the choice between being happy and being sad I'll choose happy every time. It may not seem like it but things could still be worse and following that logic I always look for the silver lining, and there always tends to be one even if it's not always something tangible. I can only move forward at this point in life one day at a time so I'm gonna do that. Regarding prognosis: on paper it's what you might think. The cancer has spread to my lungs/spine/stomach/parts of my upper G.I. in various capacities and so docs have to be honest that things can go south very fast. But my cancer has been far from normal. Though very aggressive it never presented with any tumor that we could find and we did just a massive amount of scans. So it integrated into my system and spread very fast causing me to slowly crash over a few months (it filled my bone marrow with dead cancer cells which in turn stopped my bones from being able to produce platelets and other blood essentials, among other things) and then nearly die over the course of a few weeks though I never realized how close it was till I got to the hospital. Come to find out, any moderate accident that caused me to bleed would have killed me, but that's another thing. It stopped my body from being able to manage it's own needs for a while. But the hope now is that aggressive chemo might be able to make it back off a lot faster than other cancers might since theres no tumor/mass (that we've been able to find) that they have to worry about. So that's what we've done. If/when my numbers improve we can potentially start looking at clinical trials and the like or immunotherapy and reorganize. For a long time I've been very aware of my health, nutrition and exercise routines so ultimately it likely saved my life. I had a strong body that was able to push back for a while until we were finally able to identify the problem. Never too many questions so long as they're honest.

"Long story, my FIL has been carrying for his elderly mother slowly dying of cancer that lives three hours away. His wife is also in the final clinical trials for her terminal cancer. He is under a LOT of stress, retired last year and had to drive 14 hours every week to take his dying wife to treatments. He lost an incredible amount of weight, he says due to eating challenges related to severe GERD, in the last year. He also had a surgery in the last six month to remove calcium from his pituitary gland (I think? It was challenged to get the details) and his calcium levels dropped basic to normal quickly.

"Good whatever part of the day it is for you. My five year old son, about 3ft, 43 lbs, no eczema, no asthma, if it’s relevant, has Dennie-Morgan folds, was diagnosed as peanut, walnut, pecan allergic at 10 months old and recently tested negative for all ARA peanut proteins in blood test and also negative on skin test. When I gave him peanut butter for about the fifth or sixth time I noticed him breaking out into circumoral hives, and his eyes started getting very watery and red, so I automatically assumed peanut allergy and took him straight to the urgent care. They sent us to an allergist and a skin test confirmed peanut allergy.  As the last few years passed, we’ve noticed the blood test and skin tests getting less and less reactive, and this latest round were completely negative, so the allergist recommended an oral food challenge, to see if he the allergy has resolved. 

When he was about 18 months old he was in a clinical trial for the peanut patch, but when he was fed the peanut proteins the only reaction was one tiny hive on his lip and so they judged him not allergic enough to go ahead with the trial. It was about the equivalent of 1.5 µg of peanut protein.

Our big day is tomorrow at University of Michigan. Is there any allergist here who can tell me what to expect? What do they do? How do they feed him the peanuts? I know that if he has a reaction that all the medication necessary to reverse it will be right there. I know that there is more than likely an equal chance of him passing the challenge and being declared resolved of the allergy, and I know that there is also a chance that he will not pass the challenge and then be able to go through oral immuno therapy. Any insight or words of encouragement are welcome.

I have been invited to participate in a Clinical Trial/Study in a few weeks time. From what I've heard/researched, Australian clinical trials are known for being well-regulated and heavily monitored by ethics committees.

Below is a few screenshots from the briefing which explain which drugs are being tested. If anyone requires the full document or more information feel free to PM me.

I was hoping somebody could explain to me the dangers of participating in such a trial, and hopefully give some advice regarding my participation. I was thinking of taking the full debriefing to an experienced General Practitioner.

Which questions should I be asking the organisation specifically?

"Hi there,

I'm a 42-year-old white female, 5'0"", 115 pounds, history of ulcerative colitis for which I'm on remicade and now in remission. I'm also the mother of a 5-year-old with asthma. 

I'm vaccinated for covid (3 moderna doses + booster), and got my updated vaccine along with the flu shot about a week and a half ago. 

I've had covid twice. First in December 2022, when my child brought it home from school. One round of paxlovid and I was better in a week after relatively mild, if unpleasant, illness. Then my UC flared up in May and I had to go on a prednisone taper. While on the taper, I caught covid again and this time was truly quite sick for two solid weeks. Had to delay my remicade infusion and my flare got worse, had to do two rounds of paxlovid, and have felt short of breath ever since. My UC flare has resolved and I'm back on just my regular maintenance dose of remicade. 

My five year old just tested positive for covid today. He spent most of last night coughing all over my face. Then I spent this morning cleaning up his diarrhea. My questions are:

1. Is it likely I developed any antibodies at all from my last bout of covid, given the high dose of prednisone I was on when I had it? 
2. Since it hasn't been a full two weeks yet, am I likely to have any protection from my latest dose of the vaccine? 
3. Am I doomed, AGAIN?

My rheumatologist runs clinical trials for an additional preventative drug for immunosuppressed folks and given that I live with a tiny germ machine, wanted me to be part of the trials, but. . .I have to somehow go six months without catching covid to even qualify to participate, and it seems impossible with my sweet little bioweapon spewing fluids all over his immuosuppressed mom. Also, last go-round I was SO SICK for SO LONG and my lungs still don't feel right (don't know how to describe it, even though my pulse ox is fine). 

But maybe I'm unlikely to get it again, since I had it so recently? Any advice, even if it's ""yep, you're probably doomed again"" would be helpful. Thanks in advance! (Also my kid, despite his asthma, seems ok. He's on flovent for daily prevention and when he starts coughing we do albuterol every four hours and he's not feeling GOOD, but has enough energy to want to play at least a little)",2,hi year old white female pound history ulcerative colitis remicade remission also mother year old asthma vaccinated covid moderna dos booster got updated vaccine along flu shot week half ago covid twice first december child brought home school one round paxlovid better week relatively mild unpleasant illness uc flared may go prednisone taper taper caught covid time truly quite sick two solid week delay remicade infusion flare got worse two round paxlovid felt short breath ever since uc flare resolved back regular maintenance dose remicade five year old tested positive covid today spent last night coughing face spent morning cleaning diarrhea question likely developed antibody last bout covid given high dose prednisone since full two week yet likely protection latest dose vaccine doomed rheumatologist run clinical trial additional preventative drug immunosuppressed folk given live tiny germ machine wanted part trial somehow go six month without catching covid even qualify participate seems impossible sweet little bioweapon spewing fluid immuosuppressed mom also last go round sick long lung still feel right know describe even though pulse ox fine maybe unlikely get since recently advice even yep probably doomed would helpful thanks advance also kid despite asthma seems ok flovent daily prevention start coughing albuterol every four hour feeling good enough energy want play least little,joy

"You can expect the urologist to go over the details and possible treatments of what is expected to be an RCC. If it was >4 cm, the treatment would basically be surgery, pretty much full-stop.

"Hey all, I’m currently 6 months free of a panic attack. It was a very tremendously scary moment in my life, but I’m growing and continuing to push through and make the most out of it. Throughout my own personal research on panic disorders (through viewing public academic clinical trials, case studies, etc.), it got me thinking...

At first, when my panic attacks started, I always thought that there was something seriously wrong with me and I was going to die (If you go through my post history, you can see I’ve posted on this sub before and it’s quite sad to look back on how messed up my head was at the time.) because of heart palpitations, elevated blood pressure, long episodes of sinus tachycardia, chest pain, all those horrible feelings. The internet would say stroke, heart attacks, cancer, all the things that someone my age is very, very, very unlikely to have. 

There’s of course immediate tests to rule out things like heart attacks, strokes, and so on, but how often have any of you (EMTs, Nurses, Doctors, Surgeons, anyone involved in the medical field) had a patient present with classic panic attack symptoms, but it turned out to be something else? Such as a chronic illness? I’m really curious, and I’d love to hear your outlook on how the medical community goes about adequately assessing people diagnosed with generalized panic disorder. I plan on attending medical school (fingers crossed it happens) and this is something that I would love to put time and effort into. Thank you guys, have a great one.",109,hey currently month free panic attack tremendously scary moment life growing continuing push make throughout personal research panic disorder viewing public academic clinical trial case study etc got thinking first panic attack started always thought something seriously wrong going die go post history see posted sub quite sad look back messed head time heart palpitation elevated blood pressure long episode sinus tachycardia chest pain horrible feeling internet would say stroke heart attack cancer thing someone age unlikely course immediate test rule thing like heart attack stroke often emts nurse doctor surgeon anyone involved medical field patient present classic panic attack symptom turned something else chronic illness really curious love hear outlook medical community go adequately assessing people diagnosed generalized panic disorder plan attending medical school finger crossed happens something would love put time effort thank guy great one,surprise

"Sometimes anxiety is its own diagnosis, sometimes it presents as part of a bigger diagnosis.

I see tons of folks who know they have anxiety disorder also turn out to have undiagnosed / more poorly managed than they thought / more complex underlying conditions... PCOS, thyroid issues, diabetes / pre-diabetes. Every once in a while you get a zebra like porphyria (which I recognized because I have porphyria and come from a well studied porphyria family).

Like another posted said, a work up to rule out other things can also be reassuring to someone in an acute setting. Same thing goes for outpatient care, I think it is valuable to rule other things out - especially when there are other presenting factors, family history, etc.

Congrats OP on overcoming anxiety. I had my very first textbook panic attack last February. I was near an urgent care facility and I ran in there acting like I was having a heart attack, I truly thought it was a cardiovascular event. I couldn't feel my hands or breathe, I had tunnel vision and was about to pass out, chest pain, pounding in my ears. AND IT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE. I was packing up to leave work and started to feel *a little off.*  Within an hour I was hyperventilating on an exam table. 

That experience has helped me to better understand what other people are going through when their panic or anxiety presents in very physiological ways.

PS, I also had a panic attack over the summer that I mistook for asthma, used albuterol, and made it all five times worse. So that's a confusing one to mix up for sure. I use a PRN low dose immediate release beta blocker for anxiety... And if I was having an asthma attack and took that, it could have made things worse. Such a weird catch-22.

I should get a biofeedback machine or something to help me better differentiate my own symptoms.

PPS, I do know someone with a serious history of cardiac events who also has anxiety. Her primary care has decided that having a low dose Ativan on hand is worthy to help her rule out anxiety on her own before presenting to the ED every time, thinking it's her heart.

"Sorry for my bad English, it is not my first language.

The first day of my second year in college, I woke up feeling rather faint. During the first class I started hyperventilating, and after a while I decided to go home. My mother had a feeling there was something wrong and offered going to the ER. I refused because I couldn’t miss school, as I only just started and important year-projects were assigned during the first few days. Instead, we went to a GP, not my regular one, as he didn’t have consultations that day. So this doctor that had never seen me before decided that I must been suffering panic attacks. He described antidepressants (what he didn’t tell me or my mother about) and told me to get some rest. When we left his office, I fainted. My mother alarmed him and he carried me into his cabinet. I’ve been out for about 15 minutes or so, still it didn’t strike him as alarming and he sent me home with antidepressants. (The pharmacist told us what they were.)
I, being eager to get better and go back to school again, took this medication for a few days and took a lot of rest. But it didn’t help. Three days later, we visited my regular GP, he didn’t even perform a physical exam, just confirmed the other doctor... I was suffering panic attacks.
The next day, very early in the morning, I found myself having a hard time breathing. I woke up my mother and we went to the ER, only to find out I was having a pulmonary embolism with bilateral infarction and surinfection.

"I went to the hospital for a PE in 2007. I have panic attacks and started having one when it got hard for me to breathe. The paramedics told me I was having a panic attack and that I’d be fine. Knowing that I’d had weird symptoms consistently for days, I insisted on going to the ER anyway. The ER took me seriously and a scan found the clots. Once they found the clots, I calmed down, but my heart rate had been elevated for so long that I wound up on the cardiac floor for my stay. After 24 hours on a monitor, they ruled out my heart as a problem. That was the anxiety, but the clots were real. 

The symptoms I had were not typical of panic attack for me. I had shooting leg pain three days prior that was diagnosed as a pinched nerve.

"I don't have panic attacks per se (though that was my original diagnosis many years ago). I've thought I've needed the emergency room a number of times for heart related concerns. One time I went for abdominal pain it turned out to be appendicitis that necessitated urgent surgery. It was the least urgent I have ever felt about going to the ER, and I was sure I would be sent home like all other times. I have since then abdominal pains far worse than the appendicitis that have turned up nothing and resolved on its own. The appendicitis pain was not that bad. I realized it more from its location, getting worse on standing, low-grade fever, and worse than usual tachycardia. WBC was 17k and CT scan showed it, though. I followed my instincts, but most of the time my instincts result in eye-rolls or a diagnosis of mental heath issues. I continue to have unexplained lack of stamina, chest discomforts, and periods of severe near-syncope. Sometimes chest pains have been bad enough have gone to ER. I have had to learn that I can't trust my body, or that science isn't advanced enough to help.

"I really think it just depends on the doctor. My GP is great, I really like him. He's patient and thorough. For a few months I was dealing with panic attacks, but they were so sudden and unexpected that we didn't know if anxiety was causing the attack or if some organic problem was causing the attack and the accompanying anxiety. From day 1, he told me he thinks it's just anxiety, but he said if it is just anxiety, ruling anything else out will give me the peace of mind I need to help mitigate the anxiety, so that at least I'll know nothing bad is actually happening. Knowing nothing was likely to be physically wrong, he still performed every test available to rule out a hormonal problem or vitamin/mineral deficiency, and even referred me to a cardiologist to have a cardiac workup to rule out any heart problems. Everything came back great, and his original suspicion of anxiety was confirmed. And not only was he right about the anxiety, but he was also right about the peace of mind having all those tests done gave me. It's now so much easier to manage my anxiety and try to unlearn the panic response since I know nothing is actually physically wrong, and I'm not dying. 

But yeah, he's been great. He listened to my concerns, wanted to make sure I was healthy, and wanted to alleviate my fears and concerns. In my opinion that is a great doctor, as he really did help me even though he knew nothing was wrong. I know it can be a pain to get some doctors to look into the possibility of health problems when they think it's just anxiety, but a good doctor will keep their minds open to the possibility of either or both.

"I literally just made an account to answer this. I've had POTS for most of my life and I know it's a struggle getting started with treatment, especially when there really is no one-size treatment for POTS. When I was diagnosed 2 years ago I was put on a beta blocker and a steroid called Florinef. If she's having serious low blood pressure, I would suggest getting her cardiologist to look into it. But I couldn't personally stay on it long term because it lead to extreme weight gain.

Low carb diet REALLY helps. In fact, I would say that's the number one contributor to my slow but steady recovery. Also check for any food intolerances that she may be unaware of. Take out dairy and gluten and then slowly reintroduce them to see if there's a change in symptoms. I discovered gluten is one of my top triggers for high heart rate.

If she is in bed most of the day, encourage her to sit up just a few minutes or an hour a day to build up a tolerance for an upright position. Basically a little longer than she is comfortable with it. They always tell you to exercise when you have POTS, but sometimes that's just not reasonable for where you are physically and how far it's progressed before you start treatment. Sometimes just sitting up is plenty of a workout for a POTSie heart. 

Drink lots of fluids and eat salt like candy. Gatorade is her friend and will keep her blood pressure under control. 

So see about medications like steroids and beta blockers, low carb is great and check for food intolerance, sit up as much as possible, and drink water and eat salt like it's going out of style.

"No protocols.  People panicking are our bread and butter- either because they are in pain or terrified or mental health. 

At work I am a swan ( and probably in life too), I move without any sign of stress ( despite my brain spinning), I speak very slowly and calmly, with a low voice. I minimise the number of people around them, I don’t tell their relatives to be quiet- but they know quickly this is what I want. I suggest relatives have a seat if they are flapping, or say something like, “If you are calm it will help them.” 
I explain to the patient they are fine, their oxygen levels, their heart, their BP- all is well and this is just a stress reaction that will soon pass. I keep talking, about how well they are doing. I suggest they slow their breathing and close their eyes. I usually put a reassuring hand on their arm. I explain that breathing fast will make them feel worse and talk them through some slow breaths. Any progress I congratulate them on,  even if their is no progress I tell them there is great progress and well done. 
It’s a little like a game of chicken, don’t give up, don’t show fear or concern. All is well. 

If it is their first episode I explain how easy it is for this to become a learned behaviour, and how important recognising the early signs and stopping it is- it can become entrenched and disabling if allowed to.

Hope this helps- trying to think what I actually do is tricker than you’d imagine!

"Bugger- sorry to hear that. 
We set up behaviour loops in our brain, smoking, alcohol, eating, watching YouTube - all sorts of loops. One trigger, walking into kitchen, leads to the behaviour, opening fridge and eating. 
Some people are more susceptible to setting up these loops than others , a family history of alcoholism or anxiety or other addiction is a sign you are at risk.

The options are-
1. Avoid the whole thing starting. If you know your mum was an alcoholic (as in my case)- I am very careful about how much I drink. If you have any issue in the past- addiction, eating disorder, anxiety or panic- you know for sure you are high risk- watch for loops starting and stop them straight away before they become entrenched.

2. Early on. When you notice a pattern starting confront it- I started having a little heart race about going over a bridge near me- when it was wet and dark and I was driving fast one night the car slid- just a little and the adrenaline made my heart race. Next time it was dark on the bridge I got the heart race- even though it was fine- then I started to get the heart race even in the day. Ut oh... so I drove across that bridge backwards and forwards 20 times, I went out in the wet at night to cross it- until the fear went. 

The trouble if you leave it is it can generalise- my daughter developed a fear of dogs after an incident, then she started being afraid of cats, then any furry animal...so we bought a dog. It was tough but she got through it and now loves dogs! 

3. The behaviour is entrenched already. Start exposing yourself to the trigger for the panic in a controlled fashion. If the trigger causes you to eat- expose yourself to the trigger but in a way that prevents you from then eating. Or take medication or get therapy. For panic- Cognitive Behaviour therapy works well. You can even do it on yourself. 

Goodluck! Watch out for those loops and act fast before they become entrenched.

"Therapy! Talk therapy and CBT is a great starting place for undoing these kinds of loops. There are all kinds of therapeutic approaches to treat issues like this.

Different people will respond to different methods. Some people do like to be immersed in their trigger until it holds no power over them, some people learn biofeedback techniques. Some folks practice and refine grounding techniques. I see a lot of people whose primary coping mechanism is taking an immediate release anxiolytic (like xanax) or using an illicit substance... So a lot of the longterm approach is about replacing that behavioral response to a trigger with something much safer and healthier.

I have since done blood work, met with my GI, and received another Fibroscan for a clinical trial screening. I was hoping someone could shed some light on a few things, so first I will give a broader picture of my overall health.

32M, 5'10"", 210lbs (down from 225lbs at first Fibroscan), 30BMI, generally healthy except mild asthma. .

Recent bloodwork: (let me know if you want other markers)

Albumin: 4.9

Globulin: 2.6

Bilirubin, total: 0.9

Alkaline Phosphate: 76

AST: 30

ALT: 42

WBC: 7.4

RBC: 4.64

Platelets: 259

Hemoglobin: 15.8

Ultrasounds since 12/18 have all been interpreted as mild fatty infiltration of the liver, most recent US was 11/12/2020, still mild FL.

Fibroscan 11/12/2020 - CAP 318 and 9.8kPa

Fibroscan 12/8/2020 - CAP 302 and 4.7kPa

Now, as you can see the fibrosis reading is dramatically better on the 2nd Fibroscan, as well as bloodwork being in normal range. I inquired with the sono tech as well as my GI which of the 2 tests seemed like a more accurate reading. They both felt confident that the 2nd test was more accurate for various reasons, which obviously gave me a sigh of relief. However, I still do have too high of a CAP score, and that is something I spoke about extensively with my GI. I will be continuing my intermittent fasting, exercise, no carbs, no sugar, no processed foods, and no alcohol to hopefully get my weight down to a reasonable number and at the same time allow the fatty liver to reverse itself. I was encouraged by this news and was relieved by the peace of mind with a 4.7kPa - until this afternoon when I got a call from a patient liaison from the clinical trial.

He called to inform me that I had qualified for the clinical trials because it was his estimation that the first Fibroscan reading was in fact more accurate. Upon my questioning of this, he responded that doctors do not have a keen eye for Fibroscan readings. I was informed that I indeed have F2 fibrosis and they wanted to schedule an appointment for my consultation with the trial for a drug called Elafibranor. I agreed to at least come speak with the liaison because at this point I have some serious questions and concerns about the disparity in interpretations. And so, here I am writing this post.

In any experience that any of you might have had - what might be going on here? Part of me (the optimistic side) is thinking they are casting a wide net and using the worst case scenario to grab as many patients as possible. My GI, who is associated with the trials, even told me they are starting a new study and need new patients. I am going to call him on Monday and explain to him my conversation with the trial representative, but my gut feeling is that he will tell me to go ahead with the trial. Additionally, I did a quick search on Elafibranor and it appears the previous stages of trials have produced results with not much better outcomes than the placebo. In fact, some articles I read point to the drug being scrapped along with several other drugs that have been tested in the past. So why start more studies on Elafibranor? Another concern I have is getting the placebo and having to take it for a year without any real benefit to my health.

Lastly I suppose, I am now considering getting a referral to a hepatologist at a research hospital. I do like my GI, but at this point I think going to a liver specialist may be the best bet in having my concerns addressed and perhaps getting a more accurate picture of what is actually going on.

Again, apologies for such a long post. However, I very much appreciate any insight, perspective, or shared experience. I do realize this page is for people far more advanced in liver disease than I am, and I do apologize if I am out of place in posting this here. But I figured what better place to start then with the people who have dealt with these things for years.

" I, \[30M\] 6' 170lbs white suffering from tinnitus for 8 years, have been following a new medical device for treating Tinnitus that is close to wrapping up its phase 2 clinical trials, let's say in April, and based on the first trial I am expecting the device to receive FDA approval sometime after that. This device is manufactured, so I'd expect limited availability initially. I would classify Tinnitus as a neurological issue, and not a hearing issue, as a result of new research resulting in this device showing it's hyperactive neurons in the brain that need to be relaxed/reset. I don't know if this is going to go through neurologists, ENTs or both..

1. How should I go about being one of the first patients to get access to the device?
2. How do I increase my odds of having insurance cover this treatment?

My doctor told me yesterday to eliminate about 10 different things, including coffee. When I look on the internet, I see the same list. But I came across the American College of Gastroenterolgy which said:

*An evaluation of clinical trials on the effectiveness of various lifestyle modifications finds evidence in support the some of these common lifestyle modifications, yet little or no evidence for others: “Consumption of tobacco (12 trials), chocolate (2 trials), and carbonated beverages (2 trials) and right lateral decubitus position (3 trials) were shown to lower pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), whereas consumption of alcohol (16 trials), coffee and caffeine (14 trials), spicy foods (2 trials), citrus (3 trials), and fatty foods (9 trials) had no effect. There was an increase in esophageal acid exposure times with tobacco and alcohol consumption in addition to ingestion of chocolate and fatty foods. However, tobacco and alcohol cessation (4 trials) were not shown to raise LESP, improve esophageal pH, or improve GERD symptoms. In addition, there have been no studies conducted to date that have shown clinical improvement in GERD symptoms or complications associated with cessation of coffee, caffeine, chocolate, spicy foods, citrus, carbonated beverages, fatty foods, or mint. A recent systematic review concluded that there was lack of evidence that consumption of carbonated beverages causes or provokes GERD.”*

"JnJ after Novavax?

Hey all, 

I’m in the clinical trial for the Novavax vaccine. I’ve been full vaccinated since January. Unfortunately, Novavax is still on the cusp of EMA approval and my family is traveling to France for the holidays. The US is not a green country, meaning unvaccinated travelers must have a compelling reason to go. 

Anyway, I was going to get Moderna but found out that it was recommended to take the second Moderna dose 8 weeks after the first if you’ve gotten the Novavax. 

This means I can’t get the Moderna either and am left with JnJ. Should I expect anything? Would this just be like a booster and I should expect fevers/immune response? I’m frustrated and disheartened that my vaccine isn’t approved and I have to get vaccinated again to travel. 

Thank you!

"27F, 5'6"", 125lbs, white, Canada

Existing issues - depression, endometriosis, previous low vitamin B12. Currently taking an SNRI and OCP.

&#x200B;

I spoke to my GP in May and asked to have my iron and vitamin B12 checked because I had been feeling cold, fatigued, and having pins and needles/tingling in my hands and feet. Once the results were in, she had me start taking 1250mcg of vitamin B12 and wanted a repeat blood test in 3 months. The repeat test was last week, and she called me the day after to let me know that she now wants a repeat CBC in 8 weeks because a couple of the values (WBC and neutrophils) were low. I also had a blood test done in July for a bunch of different things as my psychiatrist had referred me to a clinical trial and my WBC levels were low in that one, however neutrophils were normal (am not going to participate in the trial, don't think that's relevant though). I don't think my GP got the results of that one, and everything else tested was normal.

She didn't mention whether this was concerning or related to the previous B12 deficiency, and Google has me a little worried because I've also been having unexplained skin itching (no changes in soap/detergent/diet/environment) and night sweats (thought it was related to my meds) since sometime in the winter, and a couple of what I'm guessing are swollen lymph nodes in my groin. I would really just like some reassurance that this is likely a fluke and that I'm stitching things together that don't really belong together.

I've had 3 COVID vaccines at this point and as far as I know have not had COVID or had any illnesses/infections recently (have to test 2-3x weekly for my work).

May - WBC 5.5 (ref 4.0-11.0), neutrophils 2.5 (ref 2.0-7.5), vitamin B12 117 LO (ref 138-652)

July - WBC 3.7 LO, neutrophils 2.0

August - WBC 3.5 LO, neutrophils 1.7 LO, vitamin B12 221

"My father \[65M\] was diagnosed with chronic Hepatitis C about a couple years ago, which had already caused significant levels of cirrhotic scarring in his liver before the virus was expunged from his body. He is currently sitting at compensated stage 4 cirrhosis, and it is no longer progressing due to the absence of the virus.

The general recommendation from gastroenterologists that have seen him is that a partial or full liver transplant would be ideal to address the cirrhotic scarring, but the situation is currently not urgent enough to necessitate a transplant due to its compensatory nature (he is very healthy, fit, and active despite the scarring, and he does not drink alcohol or partake in any other substances which would be dangerous to his liver, although he will occasionally have issues with ammonia build-up causing mental confusion if he hasn't had a bowel movement in quite some time). We also have reservations about the idea of performing such major surgery on a 65-year-old, and are concerned over whether or not the physical stresses of the transplant would end up shortening his lifespan in the long term rather than extending it.

I wanted to inquire if any folks here in the medical profession were aware of any ongoing or pending clinical trials involving a proposed non-invasive / pharmaceutical solution for cirrhotic scarring caused by chronic Hepatitis C. Ideally, some kind of chemical or substance that could be delivered orally, by suppository, or even intravenously or directly into the liver by needle that would stimulate a breakdown of the cirrhotic scarring and allow room for the liver to heal itself over an extended period of time, assuming proper diet and exercise to keep a healthy, active lifestyle.",1,father diagnosed chronic hepatitis c couple year ago already caused significant level cirrhotic scarring liver virus expunged body currently sitting compensated stage cirrhosis longer progressing due absence virus general recommendation gastroenterologist seen partial full liver transplant would ideal address cirrhotic scarring situation currently urgent enough necessitate transplant due compensatory nature healthy fit active despite scarring drink alcohol partake substance would dangerous liver although occasionally issue ammonia build causing mental confusion bowel movement quite time also reservation idea performing major surgery year old concerned whether physical stress transplant would end shortening lifespan long term rather extending wanted inquire folk medical profession aware ongoing pending clinical trial involving proposed non invasive pharmaceutical solution cirrhotic scarring caused chronic hepatitis c ideally kind chemical substance could delivered orally suppository even intravenously directly liver needle would stimulate breakdown cirrhotic scarring allow room liver heal extended period time assuming proper diet exercise keep healthy active lifestyle,fear

"Hi. I had Covid in March 2020 with breathing issues on exertion which got better when resting and normal blood saturation of 99. I had similar experience again in October 2022. But this time my blood saturation kept showing 97. I had wheezing and got pulmonary function test which is not good. Recently in January end I developed chest tightness and breathing issues . My chest X-ray showed everything  is fine except in description some 3mm nodule base of left lung and they said it’s fine and not a problem . I went to ER for breathing issue and they performed chest CT angiogram and said it’s mild airway disease. I am worried about lung scarring or fibrosis . Would it show in the angiogram ? Or HRCT is the only way to know ? I am really freaking out since my grandmother and aunt died of pulmonary fibrosis but at old age . I am 39 but still worried sincecovid is causing this . 

The result of PFT is below . This was done after one month of Covid infection 


The FEV1, FVC and FEF25-75% arc reduced but the FEV1/FVC ratio is normal. The MVV is reduced. The airway resistance is increased. The lung volumes are reduced. Following administration of bronchodilators, there is no significant response. The reduced diffusing capacity indicates a mild loss of functional alveolar capillary surface. However, the diffusing capacity was not corrected for th patient's hemoglobin.

Conclusions: Moderately sever airway obstruction is present. The diffusion defect and reduced lung volumes suggest an carly parenchymal process. A clinical trial of bronchodilators may be bencficial in view of the airway obstruction

"31/Male
138lbs
Asian/White
Diagnosed late September with stage 4 signet ring adenocarcinoma of the urachus after partial cystocopy/partial bladder removal. Currently doing radiation to reduce tumor growth on spinal column and just completed my 6th cycle out of 10. Waiting to hopefully get into a clinical trial as my infusion of cisplatin/5FU did not work to stop mestastatic growth.
Taking Dexamethasone to reduce swelling caused by radiation. 

I have a very rare cancer called Signet Ring Adenocarcinoma of the Urachus. The prognosis is generally pretty poor, they thought age was on my side but this was always going to be tough with my late stage diagnosis. Now the disease has spread to my spinal column. 11-12 tumors in total with the one on my t7 being fairly advanced and the one on my t4 appearing to be a threat. I am now becoming very paranoid about where else this horrible cancer is hiding. I have accepted that even as a 31 year old this may be my final year of life as stated by the doctor. My question is, if this is my final run. What will my forseeable future look like? What does the progression of the disease start to look at for quality of life? How significantly will the pain increase? Will I still be able to maintain some semblance of my day to day? I know these are a lot of questions and given the rarity of my disease, not a lot of data, or experience will exist to inform me. I guess at this point I am asking in general and looking for advice on anyone who has had a progressive slide with any cancer and an increasingly dire prognosis. I lost my mom earlier this year but she was taken swiftly and within three months. She was here one day and then gone just as quickly. I didn't get to witness a progression because it was already so progressed and she didn't talk about it much.

"These are really really good questions. I’m not familiar enough with your situation to give you a perfect answer, but what I often see is that people with aggressive cancer do really well, until they don’t. Now is your time to determine how aggressive you want to be, whether you would wabt to spend your final days at home or in the hospital, whether you want to try every experimental treatment, even if they wouldn’t cure you, and might even make you sicker, to help the next person down the line, or if you’d rather try palliative and hospice measures in the end. Whatever you decide, get a palliative care team involved as soon as possible. They will help you through the planning for the future you have. The rest pf these unanswered questions can only be answered by your oncologist.",265,really really good question familiar enough situation give perfect answer often see people aggressive cancer really well time determine aggressive want whether would wabt spend final day home hospital whether want try every experimental treatment even cure might even make sicker help next person line rather try palliative hospice measure end whatever decide get palliative care team involved soon possible help planning future rest pf unanswered question answered oncologist,anger
"I am so sorry you have to go through this. 31 years old is far too young (if any age is really appropriate) for such a diagnosis of metastatic cancer.

I cannot agree more with the other poster who recommended discussion with palliative care who can begin exploring what is that YOU want. Let me give you a hypothetical scenario: say you really enjoy skiing and backpacking. That's your hobby/passion. Ongoing treatment may have a potential ""success"" rate of only 0.5% (again making up numbers and simplifying the scenario) but you may be debilitated by the side effects of the treatment. On the other hand, you may allow the disease to run its course and you get to do the things you love at the very end of life. It's this delicate discussion of what YOU want that you should discuss with your oncologist and palliative care - it's way too involved for us to do it via an online chatroom.

I just want to end with one more thing - people often think palliative care means giving up. It can't be further from the truth. Studies have now repeatedly shown that patients who go with palliative care live LONGER than those without. They're there for you.

Again, I'm really sorry you're going through this. It's hard to give specifics to the questions above, and without knowing your exact case, not correct for anyone of us to just guess.

"Hey in Healthcare ianad. I have friends who work in palliative care and hospice care. I am happy to answer any of your questions.
First, cancer of any kind, with aggressive treatment is a nightmare. It is painful, and can make people want to give up mid treatment, jut because of how terrible they feel. This depends on how often, what the dose is etc. Now, I hope you end up getting better, but since there's a strong possibility that you won't, I have to say that the longer you go on and the more it metastasises, the more you will be unable to do things of daily living. Brushing teeth, standing without assistance, bathing, making food, etc. Again, this is worst case scenario. Almost every cancer patient I have seen in the end of life is anorexic, in excruciating pain, and unable to do much other than talk and lightly move. Hospice will give you dignity, pain management round the clock and care for when you're no longer able to care for yourself. They will keep you comfortable and ease the burden for your family/friends with day to day care. I have seen patients walking/talking in the end and only feeling terrible and in pain, but we're not completely incapacitated. But almost all suffered the inability to perform activities of daily living 100% on their own. I'm really sorry you're going through this, and I hope the treatments are successful so you can have more time with those you love. Try to stay positive, as the mind is a really fascinating thing. That affects your body in incredible ways. Try to relax on a regular basis and laugh. Pick up comedy, listen to soothing spa music, do things that make you happy.

So if that's the case, and we've isolated the COVID-19 virus in labs, why is it taking so long (and is going to take up to a year according to some sources) to get a vaccine out? If all it takes is to weaken or kill some disease cells and put it into a needle, shouldn't we be seeing vaccines come out in the next month or two?

"Pulmonary and critical care doc here, I spend lots of my time working in the COVID ICU at a large tertiary care center in the USA (lots of the research trials are being done here).  Sorry your MIL and family are in this position.  COVID is a real strange/confusing infection that affects so many people in so many different ways (it's SUCH a unique infection that we still have so much to learn about).  Unfortunately we're seeing people like your mother-in-law all of the time, and we don't have a great understanding of the best ways to help them.  There are a few treatments most of us agree on around the world -- supportive therapies like ventilators when people progress with their breathing, proning, high PEEP for certain people (the denominator in the vent numbers you give, she's on a PEEP of 15 which is fairly high and likely appropriate), and the antiviral/steroid.  Beyond those simple things none of us have a whole lot to offer.  In some hospitals they try things that have limited data (convalescent plasma among others), but we truly don't know what things like that do (positives or negatives).  I tell my patients ""I'm not in the business of trying things.""  When we have limited data on a therapy we don't know if we're helping or hurting a patient, and when your MIL is so critically ill I would want to do everything to both help her AND not hurt her (which may mean NOT using emerging treatments).  The difficulty with the newer therapies (the slew of cocktails that just got Emergency Use Authorization with the FDA) is that they were studied in patients who were MUCH less sick than your MIL.  It's hard to understand how these therapies might affect different patient populations.

In short, if I read between the lines it looks like the ICU docs/nurses/RTs are treating your MIL in the right ways.  Keep talking with them and asking questions.  Beyond those basic things we don't have a whole lot of options at this point.  She just needs time and support.",36,pulmonary critical care doc spend lot time working covid icu large tertiary care center usa lot research trial done sorry mil family position covid real strange confusing infection affect many people many different way unique infection still much learn unfortunately seeing people like mother law time great understanding best way help treatment u agree around world supportive therapy like ventilator people progress breathing proning high peep certain people denominator vent number give peep fairly high likely appropriate antiviral steroid beyond simple thing none u whole lot offer hospital try thing limited data convalescent plasma among others truly know thing like positive negative tell patient business trying thing limited data therapy know helping hurting patient mil critically ill would want everything help hurt may mean using emerging treatment difficulty newer therapy slew cocktail got emergency use authorization fda studied patient much le sick mil hard understand therapy might affect different patient population short read line look like icu doc nurse rts treating mil right way keep talking asking question beyond basic thing whole lot option point need time support,fear

"Hi docs, I just have a quick question! 

My Mother-in-law (late 60s) was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer about four years ago. I can't remember what type, I just know she's never been a smoker or drinker or did any drugs. It was found because of excruciating pain in her back that had her bedridden. The cancer had spread to her spine. 

Anyway. After four years, her meds that she was on has finally started to stop working (she was originally told it'd work for about a year and a half), and she was a candidate for a clinical trial with this medication along with something new. 

She went in for her testing yesterday, and we found out today that she actually didn't qualify because her bilirubin is high. I haven't talked to my husband anymore since then, so, I'm not sure if they've gotten any new info or not, but. I was just wondering... Does this mean it has probably spread to her liver? She had her scans a few weeks ago, and as far as we know, nothing popped up for her liver, but, could it have been missed? 

I understand that you might not be able to answer due to lack of info and the fact that she isn't your patient, and that's okay! It's more that I was curious and kinda wanting to know what to expect. 

Thank you! 

Info: Female, USA,  late 60s, unsure of weight but I'd say slightly overweight.

Edit: apparently there was originally a lesion on her liver a month ago, but it was tiny and  inconclusive. They took her in for new scans today, and an ultrasound, and that spot is nowhere to be found.

What kind of imaging of the liver was it?

Elevated bilirubin can be from 3 things usually. Either a blockage at the bile ducts level, a blockage inside the liver causing impaired bile excretion or hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells). If there are any new meds, some of them can cause cholestasis as well. It doesn't necessarily mean that the disease has spread to the liver but it's a possibility. Mets might not show up depending on the time of imaging and use of contrast.

This should be brought up to her oncologist and family physician.",2,unit bilirubin assuming mg dl significantly high kind imaging liver elevated bilirubin thing usually either blockage bile duct level blockage inside liver causing impaired bile excretion hemolysis destruction red blood cell new med cause cholestasis well necessarily mean disease spread liver possibility mets might show depending time imaging use contrast brought oncologist family physician,fear

Of note, on Sunday she had a fever and chills, and was taking Tylenol. She only had the fever for about 24 hours, though, and it's the only fever she's had in a long time. Could that contribute to anything?

I asked my husband about her gallbladder, and he said according to the ultrasound, it was ""decompressed"", which I'm assuming just means empty. But, I suppose there could possibly be a stone blocking a duct, right? Does the bilirubin tend to get that high from stones? She hasn't complained about any pain, but, she also keeps everything to herself with pain. 

I'm pretty sure her oncologist is in the loop now, I think he's the one who has ordered some of the additional testing today.

"It has been extremely tough for me to digest this, but my father has been diagnosed with Parkinson's. My primary question is: Are there any clinical trials or cutting-edge treatments that are designed to stop or slow the progression of the disease? I have read a little bit about MSDC-0160 and Nilotinib but I can't find how the clinical trials went or if these are an option for my Dad? 

My dad is 66 and was diagnosed after having a tremor in his hand (started in his thumb). He has seen a movement disorder specialist and she prescribed him a drug (Not sure which one - we are fighting with the insurance company to pay for it). However, the doctor said that there aren't any drugs out there that stop/slow the disease - they only treat the symptoms. She said that some patients do well with this disease for a long period of time (20+ years), while other patients do poorly after a short period of time. I am trying to be as optimistic as possible, but I don't know how reasonable it is that he won't ever be severely incapacitated. I am scared =( 

I may need to talk to a therapist but what depresses me the most are 2 things: One is watching my hero suffer at the hands of Parkinson's, and also how my 1 year old daughter will know him in the future. I want her to know him as I know him, not someone who has bad Parkinson's. She won't be old enough to understand.

Diet - Eat Sensibly. 

Sleep (try to) get a good nights sleep.

With Parkinson's our brain is effected, but our nerves and muscles still function.  At 55 I couldn't get out of a chair without difficulty and my shuffle was pretty clear that Parkinson's had taken a toll on me. My MDS, PT, Boxing Coaches, and everyone had a plan but it takes hard to work to keep at it. I'm still working, but cut back on duties, but at age 60 I'm doing something I would have told you was impossible. I ran a 5K race!  I'm not a fast runner, I did a face plant, but finished at 42 minutes.  

One of the most amazing men I have meet was still active on his family farm. He admitted to slowing down but still got up daily for chores and do physically active work. He was diagnosed and started Sinemet at age 52. When I meet him he was 90 years old!  I've seen other people who diagnosed at age 60 thought nothing they could do, sat on the coach just eating. They died 8 years later.

At 66 with Parkinson's he still has years ahead of him.   With the boxing programs they are designed for the ""fighter"" with Parkinson's and their ""cornerman"" that attends to give them support. Usually my kids join me on occasion, but have all commented they can not believe how fit I have become.

It’s important that he’s under the care of a PD specialist who can continue to manage his meds in the coming years. This is one of those conditions where having a close relationship with one doctor can really help. They will be able to inform you about any drug trials.

In my country (in Europe) we have an excellent Parkinson’s charity that can support him and you through the diagnosis. Suggest you look up to see what help is available.

"18 months ago my father (78) was diagnosed with early stage Alzheimers. The diagnosis was made by a neurologist at Banner Health. This Banner hospital deals exclusively with Alzheimer's, and is very well regarded.

Fast forward 12 months: Father has been on Donzepil (Aricept) for the preceding year and as of 6 months ago has been in a clinical trial. This is the AstraZeneca/Eli Lilly drug. Great, right?

Well, as the disease has progressed, it seems more likely than not that he in fact has Lewes body dementia. Even his neurologist has mentioned this in passing. Recently, studies have shown that medications used to 'treat' Alzheimers patients can have a deleterious impact on LBD patients.

The ethical issue is not the misdiagnosis (if it is) per se, as this is quite common even with highly trained neurologists (it is not at all unusual for diagnoses to morph into LBD). But, rather, all the potential conflicts of interest in regard to the clinical trial, not to mention the fact that he perhaps (or placebo, we do not know) is taking a medication that is GREATLY harming him. If the neurologist now has good reason to suspect LBD, then is it not incumbent on him to intervene? Are there potential liability issues preventing him from doing so? And on and on? Any feedback/suggestions would be highly welcome!

"The treatment options for MS are vast these days but steroids are always a good starting point for an acute flare.

Choose the neurologist that is best for your circumstances. All neurologists are highly skilled and the treatment of MS is one of their main tasks.

I am British so we don’t have the same health system but as far as out of state treatment you need to consider that this is usually a life long condition and long distance treatment may limit you access to acute treatment.

Personally my thoughts on naturopathy are at best ambivalent. There is no evidence to support it however if you feel that it is something you want to do then there is usually no harm in it, and if you experience something positive then that’s great. Just always be aware of exactly what you are putting into your body there is potential for harm if you’re not careful.

You need to be referred to clinical trials usually. There are often very tight restrictions on eligibility. Always bear in mind that just because a drug is new and I’m an active trial does not mean that it is any good in treating your condition.

Best wishes for the future and we are always here if you ever need an anonymous physician opinion.",9,treatment option m vast day steroid always good starting point acute flare choose neurologist best circumstance neurologist highly skilled treatment m one main task british health system far state treatment need consider usually life long condition long distance treatment may limit access acute treatment personally thought naturopathy best ambivalent evidence support however feel something want usually harm experience something positive great always aware exactly putting body potential harm careful need referred clinical trial usually often tight restriction eligibility always bear mind drug new active trial mean good treating condition best wish future always ever need anonymous physician opinion,joy
"Med student - 

MS is a condition that you'll have to control for the rest of your life, and it's impossible to predict when and why flare-ups will happen. As a result, I think you should choose a neurologist with the idea that you two will be partners for life in managing your symptoms. It may be best to find or connect to a neurologist more on the academic side of medicine, as they'd have built-in access to the state-of-the art information. Be upfront about telling them you want aggressive treatment, as well. To my understanding, if you're a healthy, relatively young patient with no other comorbidities, your doctor can advocate for your being placed into clinical trials. Now, as someone with a lot of experience in these trials - I would say to keep your expectations low, as I believe something around 70-90% of Phase II and III clinical trials fail.  

I personally would not start naturopathy. It's not grounded in evidence, and I worry it is at best placebo - at worst preying on the hopes of patients who are poorly served by modern medicine. However, I know some people find it helpful. If you were to get in to naturopathy, I would at the very least let your doctor know about any changes in diet and herbal supplements you're interested in taking before you start, as they may interfere with medications or render you ineligible for a clinical trial. 

Good luck, and best wishes",3,med student m condition control rest life impossible predict flare ups happen result think choose neurologist idea two partner life managing symptom may best find connect neurologist academic side medicine built access state art information upfront telling want aggressive treatment well understanding healthy relatively young patient comorbidities doctor advocate placed clinical trial someone lot experience trial would say keep expectation low believe something around phase ii iii clinical trial fail personally would start naturopathy grounded evidence worry best placebo worst preying hope patient poorly served modern medicine however know people find helpful get naturopathy would least let doctor know change diet herbal supplement interested taking start may interfere medication render ineligible clinical trial good luck best wish,anger
"My SO has MS, so hopefully I can answer some of these for you, from first hand experience!

Read read read. Read a neurologist's reviews from other patients. Read about their education on MS. Meet with a few of them. Hear how they guide you to a treatment and their reasoning behind it. Ask how they handle relapses or flares in symptoms. Do they seem like someone you would be comfortable discussing potential issues with? 

About going to a specialty clinic, that really depends. Meet with some locally and see how you vibe with them. 

The new thought involving Multiple Sclerosis is that when you begin to treat it with one of the newer medications when it is first caught, people seem to be better off. My SO worked his way from Rebif, which is an injectable medication that he would give himself at home, to one of the newer medications called Gilenya. He has been involved in the trial for years now. No new lesions since he started it. So, see what treatment options these neurologists are guided towards. If one medication doesn't work for you, try another. If you're having troublesome symptoms, work with your doctor to figure out solutions. 

There is an official website to search clinical trials. I believe it is clinical trials.gov

Ultimately, keep moving. Take care of yourself. Keep physically active. Eat and drink well. Continue to remain social. Having your support system is important. Do things you enjoy. 

There is a super awesome r/MultipleSclerosis group as well!

"There's been a new study showing, only in pre-clinical trials (animal and cell tests), that the blood pressure medication Hydralazine can help with Parkinson's Disease.

"*I'm NOT A DOC*

I am an advocate for those with Parkinson's, and yes I have  Parkinson's.

Over the past ten years I have seen many drugs thought to have significant benefit, but later really didn't help.

From the researchers:
>Rochet cautions that the drug may not ultimately be the best therapy for Parkinson's. ""Because it is used to lower blood pressure, it might not be the best choice for Parkinson's patients. Or, we may find there is a therapeutic window, a lower dose, that could work without leading to unwanted side-effects,"" he says. ""Regardless, this drug serves as a proof of principle for us to find other drugs that work as a scavenger for acrolein.""

Look at Fox Trial Finder to see if there is ongoing research in your area.
https://foxtrialfinder.michaeljfox.org/

For me, I keep having issues with blood pressure not regulating.  160/100 to 100/60 is my ""normal range"" that drives the medical community crazy. So I tell them ahead of time it is part of Parkinson's (everyone is different). So Hydralazine wouldn't work for me.

History: 
Dad was diagnosed with this cancer and 1st line chemo worked for a few months in 2020. Later half of 2020 he had many reoccurring infections due to 1) Sludge blocking bile ducts or 2) Ingrowth of tumor in bile duct. In either case he was admitted to ER once a month for 7 months and treated with antibiotics to control infection and a PTC gallbladder drain or multiple insertion/removal of metal and plastic stents to clear the blockage. 

His clinical trial treatments keep getting delayed due to these reoccuring infections. Our GOAL is to keep him infection and blockage free as long as possible so he can continue treatments. Doctors are running out of options hence reaching out. 

Questions: 
1. Any suggestions to prevent or prolong sludge build up? He is now a vegetarian and on low fat diet (no deep fried or oily foods, no dairy or wheat)

This medicine is not available in her country outside of the trial and, unfortunately, the trial has ended and her pain has returned. I would like to bring her to the U.S. for treatment and medicine, but I'm not sure what the options are or the legality of this. I'm hoping someone here will be able to offer some advice for us. A letter with more detail from my aunt is below:

>I live in Poland. I'm 50 years old. Two years ago I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Besides this disease, I'm suffering from some other ones related to disfunction of my immune system , autoaggression, and those are: albinizm, hyperthyroidism and pernicious anemia. Through the years I manage to contol the above pretty well with medication, but rheumatiod arthrisis is the one that I suffer from the most. From the beggining this disease has been very aggresive and modifying antirheumatic drugs were not helping me. I was taking methotrexate 20mg for over a year, but it was not working for me. I respond very well to glikokortykoids, but the dosage has to be increased constantly and they have a lot of side effects.

> In Poland, biologocal treatment is available only through clinical studies and those are exteremly difficult to qualify for. Patients that can benefit from those programs are young people, usually between 30 - 40 years old at the most.

> I have been suffering a lot for the past two years, I have been feeling very poorly, having daily inflammations and changes on my X-ray. I have been searching for any help I can get and this way I was able to find a institution that does the clinical studies and where the patients receive etanercept. From the very first dosage of this medicine, I started to feel better. Besides 50mg of etanercept (weekly) I am also taking methrotexate 15mg and folic acid. Been doing this treatment for the past seven months. My life has changed for better but unfortunately the clinical study has now ended... I will have no choice but to go back to the treatment from before, that is methotrexate and steroids, and that is not helping me.",1,f lb aunt poland suffering many year rheumatoid arthritis found relief condition clinical trial etanercept enbrel medicine available country outside trial unfortunately trial ended pain returned would like bring u treatment medicine sure option legality hoping someone able offer advice u letter detail aunt live poland year old two year ago diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis ra besides disease suffering one related disfunction immune system autoaggression albinizm hyperthyroidism pernicious anemia year manage contol pretty well medication rheumatiod arthrisis one suffer beggining disease aggresive modifying antirheumatic drug helping taking methotrexate mg year working respond well glikokortykoids dosage increased constantly lot side effect poland biologocal treatment available clinical study exteremly difficult qualify patient benefit program young people usually year old suffering lot past two year feeling poorly daily inflammation change x ray searching help get way able find institution clinical study patient receive etanercept first dosage medicine started feel better besides mg etanercept weekly also taking methrotexate mg folic acid treatment past seven month life changed better unfortunately clinical study ended choice go back treatment methotrexate steroid helping,sadness
Earlier this year It was found I have tumors in both of my eyes. They did a MRI and did not see anything the growths are fairly small (2mm or slightly larger) I knew because of their size they likely wouldn’t show up on the MRI. The doctors decided to take a wait and see approach (no pun intended). Since then I have noticed some changes in my vision. My question is if after my appointment next week the doctor says they don’t think treatment is necessary can I tell him that it is not acceptable to “watch and wait”  and demand they biopsy and treat the tumors so I do not loose any more vision? I have reached out to a doctor in Canada who has a clinical trial that is promising one of the doctors on his team brought up the possibility of B-DUMP. I don’t completely understand what b-dump is. Can I get a doctor to help answer these questions please?,3,earlier year found tumor eye mri see anything growth fairly small mm slightly larger knew size likely show mri doctor decided take wait see approach pun intended since noticed change vision question appointment next week doctor say think treatment necessary tell acceptable watch wait demand biopsy treat tumor loose vision reached doctor canada clinical trial promising one doctor team brought possibility b dump completely understand b dump get doctor help answer question please,joy

I have a rare genetic condition that causes chronic and sometimes acute serum potassium depletion (hypokalemia). Some company sells small device that allows you to mesure your EKG at home with the help of a smartphone - this device seems to work pretty well. They have used the EKG as a proxy to measure serum potassium concentrations successfully 3 years ago in a clinical trial but the feature is not open to the public yet. How ""visible"" would potassium level changes appear to the ""layperson"" in an EKG? I have found several papers in medical journals that show important modifications of U waves but I'm not a trained doctor and not exactly used to analyzing EKGs (but would nonetheless be more than ready to put *a lot* of effort in learning to analyze those).

"Hi Reddit,

I'm so worried about my father and it turns out it has some serious heart issues. I've always thought he is just having high BP but I thought he was managing this with meds.

He has:  
\- HFpEF of left ventricle  
\- severe LAE (59mm)  
\- paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and flutter \~100/min  
\- oligosymptomatic mitral stenosis with mild regurgitation - 9mmg, MVA 1.2-1.5cm2  
\- normal contractility of the left ventricle EF: 55%  
\- BP \~150/95 with occasional spikes to even 170/125  


I've heard that due to LAE he might not qualify for 3d ablation to fix the Atrial Fibrillation which iiuc is the main problem.

He had recently episodes of dizziness when changing position (siting/laying -> standing up).

We are currently consulting multiple doctors and getting mixed opinions: from seriously should consider heart stimulation to it's nothing serious and manage BP and observe.   


I wonder what are our therapeutic options here if any and I wonder if LAE can be reversed?

I feel helpless and searching pubmed so any advise on what are our therapeutic options in this case would help. I currently don't know what to look for. Are there any clinical trials or bleeding-edge new therapies that can help?

Many thanks,

 I've been on Fin for two years. Still on now. I take 0.5 mg EOD (about 0.25 mg ED).

My doctor gave me this medication for hair loss. She said it was perfectly safe and if there were side effects. they would disappear once I come off.

All I hear everywhere is how this drug is harmful and messes up hormones level.

I feel like the reporting of the studies is pretty crap

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2212246

""A 2015 meta analysis found that none of the clinical trials testing finasteride in hair loss had adequate safety reporting and did not provide sufficient information to establish the safety profile for finasteride as a treatment for hair loss. The study concluded the existing clinical trials of finasteride for hair loss provide very limited information on toxicity, are of poor quality, and seem to be systematically biased toward under-detection of adverse events."".

Also,

""A 2016 meta-analysis found that sexual dysfunction, including erectile dysfunction, loss of libido, and reduced ejaculate, may occur in 3.4 to 15.8% of men treated with finasteride or dutasteride.[22] 

The studies just look at ED. They are very black and white. I don't have ED now but my sex drive is certainly lower than before. I used to masturbate 5-6 times a week wheras now I do it only 2X a week. My erections are also not as strong I feel.

The studies don't look to see if it can lower sex drive. It just focus on ED.

I'm also facing some depression and anxiety. There is no proof that the side effects will go away either. So many people say they still have them.

"Finasteride absolutely messes with hormone levels--that's it mechanism of action (specifically, inhibition of the conversion of testosterone into the more potent DHT). Most of the safety data for finasteride comes from trials for BPH (enlarged prostate) which did demonstrate erectile dysfunction and decreased sex drive. No mention of any psychiatric side effects as far as I can tell. Although you're taking the drug for a different indication and at a lower dose, you're subject to the same side effects. The package insert states ""resolution occurred in men who discontinued therapy...due to these side effects"" which we take as reassurance that there aren't any appreciable long-term adverse effects. So to answer your question, the available evidence seems to indicate that the drug is ""safe"" which is not the same as ""free of side effects."" If you're having intolerable side effects you should talk to your doctor about stopping the medication.",3,finasteride absolutely mess hormone level mechanism action specifically inhibition conversion testosterone potent dht safety data finasteride come trial bph enlarged prostate demonstrate erectile dysfunction decreased sex drive mention psychiatric side effect far tell although taking drug different indication lower dose subject side effect package insert state resolution occurred men discontinued therapy due side effect take reassurance appreciable long term adverse effect answer question available evidence seems indicate drug safe free side effect intolerable side effect talk doctor stopping medication,sadness

"IANAD, but I did a bit of research on hair loss as I was going through telogen effluvium, and stumbled upon this forum : [https://www.pfsfoundation.org/](https://www.pfsfoundation.org/)

I don't know if \*everything\* on this site can be attributed to finasteride alone, we have to consider that for hair loss this is a long term medication, and a lot can happen during a span of years.

However, there are also several hair loss forums out there with many daily active users that take finasteride and/or minoxidil, and some others are more daring and try other, possibly illegal, drugs which are still in clinical trials for hair loss. 

I suggest looking through both sides and see for yourself what you think.

I'm pretty sure one of the most common side effects is watery semen that should go away after some time, and acute pain in the testes, that should also go away.

"My mom was just diagnosed with a rectal melanoma and is pretty hush-hush about the entire thing because she doesn’t want to scare her kids. She is 52f, probably around 170lbs and she had surgery to have a mass removed between Thanksgiving and Christmas. She went in for a scan a few days ago, and it looks like it has spread to her lungs and there’s another mass building in her rectum. What I read online is pretty scary and doesn’t give me a lot of hope that this is survivable. She starting immunotherapy this week, and her doctors are suggesting that they look for clinical trials for some thing to help her.

All I’m looking for is, realistically, what are her chances of survival. I want to be prepared for what’s coming, especially because I have a younger brother and sister who need more support if she’s not here. Don’t be afraid to scare me or be too honest.

"Hi all.  
Recently, I've discovered I seem to have a fear of clinically related things.  
This all started because I signed up for a clinical trial. Now doing a clinical trial is something I have ALWAYS wanted to do, ever since I first knew about them as a child- because I liked the idea of making my small contribution to science, and potentially stepping into the unknown.  

About 3 weeks ago I signed up to a clinical trial and got accepted to go for my screening, where bloods would be taken etc. The trial was to examine the effects of vaccinations on the body, I would be given a currently on the market Hepatitis B vaccine and have blood samples taken over several months. I knew what it entailed. But as the doctor was talking to me about it all, not even anything sinister, I just lost it. I felt lightheaded, nauseous, I couldn't focus on what he was saying. I had to put my foot out forward in an attempt to steady myself, even though I was sitting down. I felt incredibly clammy and knew I was sweating a lot.  

So I told the doctor I wasn't feeling great, and he took me through to another room of the facility with the beds in to lie down. All the nurses seemed crazy concerned and quite baffled when I explained that I just came over funny, it hadn't been anything specific the doctor had been saying, I guessed it was just the anticipation, After lying down I felt 100% better and the feeling passed. I was given some water & went back in with the doctor, finished the conversation, and said I would still go ahead. I felt absolutely fine during the blood sample, just a little nervous I guess but I looked away, no more dizzy spells, no more attacks. I later found out I got accepted onto the trial, however some complications with my employer changing his mind about my holiday days meant I could no longer commit, which I was devastated about.  

Since then I have left that employer as of last week, and I decided I wanted to do a trial still. Seeing as I missed the boat on the Hep B trial, I discovered another trial, it payed REALLY well for just 10-18 days in quarantine, because they would be giving you a common cold, flu, or HPV virus. So yeah, I knew I'd be getting sick, but I was still really excited to do it. I was scheduled for my test screening today,  

So I get to the test screening, all fine, still really hyped, and I went into a room where this time they had iPads and headphones set up. You had to watch an 8 minute video on the iPads which talked about the process and the facility and the tests e.t.c. And then I felt it hit me again. By the time I put my left foot out to steady myself I knew I was going through exactly the same attack. I got up to get some water, and went back to the video, but that didn't help me. I stood up and took the admin lady to one side and said I couldn't go through with it. Same story, she asked me to come through to the beds where they got a nurse, I had blood pressure checks, they insisted I have a cup of tea and some biscuits e.t.c. I was there way longer than I felt I had to be as of course after lying down for 20 seconds I felt fine again.  

Long story short, I REALLY want to go back- I know they're running screenings all this week and I just want to phone up and request a second chance- but I can't go in there again just to have the same thing happen- or worse, have it all happen during the trial itself. But it's something I feel I HAVE to get past, so any advice/insight is appreciated.",1,hi recently discovered seem fear clinically related thing started signed clinical trial clinical trial something always wanted ever since first knew child liked idea making small contribution science potentially stepping unknown week ago signed clinical trial got accepted go screening blood would taken etc trial examine effect vaccination body would given currently market hepatitis b vaccine blood sample taken several month knew entailed doctor talking even anything sinister lost felt lightheaded nauseous focus saying put foot forward attempt steady even though sitting felt incredibly clammy knew sweating lot told doctor feeling great took another room facility bed lie nurse seemed crazy concerned quite baffled explained came funny anything specific doctor saying guessed anticipation lying felt better feeling passed given water went back doctor finished conversation said would still go ahead felt absolutely fine blood sample little nervous guess looked away dizzy spell attack later found got accepted onto trial however complication employer changing mind holiday day meant could longer commit devastated since left employer last week decided wanted trial still seeing missed boat hep b trial discovered another trial payed really well day quarantine would giving common cold flu hpv virus yeah knew getting sick still really excited scheduled test screening today get test screening fine still really hyped went room time ipads headphone set watch minute video ipads talked process facility test e c felt hit time put left foot steady knew going exactly attack got get water went back video help stood took admin lady one side said go story asked come bed got nurse blood pressure check insisted cup tea biscuit e c way longer felt course lying second felt fine long story short really want go back know running screening week want phone request second chance go thing happen worse happen trial something feel get past advice insight appreciated,joy
"32 y/o female, 5’7”, 135lbs, Caucasian.

Sorry this is long-winded, but my case is far from typical.

I have chemo (likely from the vincristine) induced peripheral neuropathy in my feet. I’ve had both Achilles’ tendons surgically released due to foot drop & GVHD that worked together to create tightening/shortening of the tendons. I have severe fat pad atrophy in my feet and it is insanely debilitating at times.

I will be 5 years post allogenic stem cell transplant (sibling donor 10/10 HLA match) for B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ph-) in July.  I was on a pediatric clinical trial (COG AALL 1131, A Phase III Randomized Trial For Newly Diagnosed High Risk B-Lymphoblastic Leukemia) due to the aggressive nature of my ALL (when I was diagnosed my hgb was at 3.4)... and I had a high number of genetic mutations on my FISH test, so I was considered Very High Risk.  Needless to say, this kept me as an inpatient for 165 days with 5 weeks being in critical condition on a ventilator in the ICU. The clinical trial actually completely killed my bone marrow and was on blood products for approximately 3 months leading up to the transplant which was done on an emergent basis.  My body went through an immense amount of fungal/bacterial infections. I was septic, and had tons of issues.. most organs were failing with the exception of my kidneys.  I do still have iron overload that did require therapeutic phlebotomies. My hgb is now at 16 and I still have high ferritin & hct that is still naturally depleting over time.

I’ve had a weird collection of issues that have been manageable, but my feet really drive me insane. I was in a wheelchair 2 years post transplant with intensive PT to try to lengthen the tendons without surgical intervention. Ultimately I hit a plateau and surgery was required for me to be able to walk. I now most often use a cane for balance due to the neuropathy. I also have atrophied calves. I used to dance competitively, hike, whitewater kayak, explore, and etc... so this is a huge lifestyle change for me.

I am no longer on Gabapentin because I hate the fatigue that is associated with it. Occasionally I do use CBD lotions and use CBD tincture daily.
Also, I use:
Acyclovir 800mg, 1 po bid
Onnit Key Minerals, 2 po bid 
New Chapter Organics (Women’s 40+) 
Lorazepam 1mg, qhs prn sleep

No smoking or drinking, but have self medicated with edible cannabis products when in legal regions. 

SO - now that my brief insight is out of the way... I have tried insoles and PT to help with the pain of the fat pad atrophies with minimal success. I’ve seen articles regarding things like autolipotransplantation where people have great successes. However, despite the successes I know my risk factors are highly unique. I have experienced a large majority of surgeons reluctant to even touch me due to the risk of GVHD associated complications. My GVHD is dormant and I’ve actually just now started the reimmunization process. 

Does anyone have experience with either experience with the fat pad treatments and/or GVHD specialists?! I do go to a cancer center with an amazingly smart Hematologist/Onco, but the other departments that I see can be less than desirable when it comes to confidence with my case complexity. 

I hope you all can follow this ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ",1,female lb caucasian sorry long winded case far typical chemo likely vincristine induced peripheral neuropathy foot achilles tendon surgically released due foot drop gvhd worked together create tightening shortening tendon severe fat pad atrophy foot insanely debilitating time year post allogenic stem cell transplant sibling donor hla match b cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ph july pediatric clinical trial cog aall phase iii randomized trial newly diagnosed high risk b lymphoblastic leukemia due aggressive nature diagnosed hgb high number genetic mutation fish test considered high risk needle say kept inpatient day week critical condition ventilator icu clinical trial actually completely killed bone marrow blood product approximately month leading transplant done emergent basis body went immense amount fungal bacterial infection septic ton issue organ failing exception kidney still iron overload require therapeutic phlebotomy hgb still high ferritin hct still naturally depleting time weird collection issue manageable foot really drive insane wheelchair year post transplant intensive pt try lengthen tendon without surgical intervention ultimately hit plateau surgery required able walk often use cane balance due neuropathy also atrophied calf used dance competitively hike whitewater kayak explore etc huge lifestyle change longer gabapentin hate fatigue associated occasionally use cbd lotion use cbd tincture daily also use acyclovir mg po bid onnit key mineral po bid new chapter organic woman lorazepam mg qhs prn sleep smoking drinking self medicated edible cannabis product legal region brief insight way tried insole pt help pain fat pad atrophy minimal success seen article regarding thing like autolipotransplantation people great success however despite success know risk factor highly unique experienced large majority surgeon reluctant even touch due risk gvhd associated complication gvhd dormant actually started reimmunization process anyone experience either experience fat pad treatment gvhd specialist go cancer center amazingly smart hematologist onco department see le desirable come confidence case complexity hope follow _ ツ _,sadness

"I’m a chest physician - I’d advise avoiding stem cell treatment. There’s no evidence showing that it’s an effective therapy for emphysema. 

The most important measure is smoking cessation. 

Inhalers (‘triple therapy’ - bronchodilator, steroid inhaler and anti-muscarinic) can help with symptoms. 

Exercise is also an important measure, we offer pulmonary rehab classes in the UK - I’m guessing something similar is available wherever you are. Staying active is key. 

It’s also important that he has his flu and pneumococcal jab on a yearly basis. 

He’s a higher risk of chest infections - his GP ought to provide him with a ‘rescue pack’ of antibiotics and steroids that he can take if he starts coughing up increased amounts of purulent (green) sputum.",3,chest physician advise avoiding stem cell treatment evidence showing effective therapy emphysema important measure smoking cessation inhaler triple therapy bronchodilator steroid inhaler anti muscarinic help symptom exercise also important measure offer pulmonary rehab class uk guessing something similar available wherever staying active key also important flu pneumococcal jab yearly basis higher risk chest infection gp ought provide rescue pack antibiotic steroid take start coughing increased amount purulent green sputum,fear

" My lower right third molar extraction performed 1 year ago was with complications -- my lingual nerve was damaged and now the right side of the tongue was (and still is) partially numb. I can feel mild nerve shocks when pressing on my lingual nerve and the lower part of my gums. The dentist that performed the surgery on me recommended that I go through a 'laser therapy' treatment to aid in nerve restoration. I am skeptical as to whether this type of treatment is based on strong evidence of effectiveness and I'm not sure whether I should spend my money on it.

I'm assuming my dentist was referring to 'low-level laser therapy' when they mentioned 'laser therapy', and so I've done some effort to inform myself of the procedure. [The page describing the treatment on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_laser_therapy) says that ""the evidence for LLLT being useful in dentistry, and in the treatment of wound healing is unclear."" Science writer Paul Ingraham [says that the treatment is 'bullshit'](https://www.painscience.com/articles/laser-therapy.php). [A paper](https://aap.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1902/jop.2006.050417) published in 2006 states that there is ""a considerable conflict in results for both laboratory studies and clinical trials, even when using the same laser wavelength ""

So my question is -- is it a scam? Or is it worth it?

Hi, so recently the incident above happened where I was just sitting around relaxing and my heart rate spiked. I felt my heart pounding in my chest, I was sweating a ton and it hurt to breath. I ended up going to the hospital and they did a Modified Valsalva on the way and it got rid of my symptoms. My ECG is clear with no notable deformations, so they are assuming it must be an extra bundle of nerves that fired to cause my heart rate to spike. They said I had a PSVT episode/attack (Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia). This only happens once every two or three years but this time I was out of commission and exhausted for three weeks.

Anyways the options they are giving me is a clinical trial (maybe not), heart medication (apparently very exhausting), or catheter abolition (terrifying). Does any one have any experience with these options and could recommend something, or are there other options. I’m really at a loss here and kind of terrified.

"I have a skin disease that currently has no solid treatment, but with a whole lot of research in the two major fields it covers, I came up with a compound that actually works. Originally I tried to get a compounding pharmacy to make the ointment but both doctors had issues with the pharmacies they knew so I went ahead and did it on my own. Both of my doctors were shocked when they saw the results.

I’d like to get it on the market but medicine is NOT my field. I’m assuming clinical trials would come next but I don’t even know if that’s accurate. All I know is the whole process is far more complex than I can even imagine so where do I go from here?

Should I seek out an doctor that works in a university and is geared more towards research?

">​Should I seek out an doctor that works in a university and is geared more towards research? 

Yes. If it warrants further distribution, then someone would have to start by writing to the FDA to get an approval to start phase I trials. Then patients have to be recruited, a study has to be designed and implemented, and these patients have to be followed. Then there's phases II and III, which similar procedures have to be done. The whole process takes years to a decade. The most common way this gets done is a company gets formed with the sole purpose of trying to get a drug to market. If it fails, which a large majority do, then only the company is at risk and minimizes personal liability.",1,seek doctor work university geared towards research yes warrant distribution someone would start writing fda get approval start phase trial patient recruited study designed implemented patient followed phase ii iii similar procedure done whole process take year decade common way get done company get formed sole purpose trying get drug market fails large majority company risk minimizes personal liability,anger

"Hi! I’m 30F and 29 weeks pregnant with my first child. My husband and I are educators, so from what I’m hearing, our turn is coming up for vaccinations in the next couple months. I am choosing to wait until after I have the baby since the clinical trials did not test in pregnant women (except for the small amount who found out they were pregnant after beginning the trial). I follow the rules diligently at work and the students are very good with doing so as well. I go on leave in a month so I will be able to isolate at home until the baby comes.

I want my husband to get the vaccine since he will be working in school and coming home each day to a very pregnant wife, and shortly, a new born. I also don’t want to transmit the virus to my parents who will be helping out a lot with the baby.

He is very concerned that the vaccine may effect fertility and impede our chances of having a second child. Or that it may cause issues with our second child if we do get pregnant. It’s just so new- so I understand why he is scared. 

I know there is a lot of “junk science” and false claims out there scaring people away from the vaccine. There supposedly was a German doctor who teamed with a former head researcher of Pfizer to claim that the vaccine will cause sterilization because it blocks an important protein needed to grow the placenta.

I personally believe these claims are just pushed by the anti-vax movement and should be taken with a grain of salt, but it is also such an important aspect of our lives, that I wouldn’t want to risk infertility or birth defects.

"Hi, so im 20m, 6’ 2, 175. From Canada and i was just diagnosed w this extremely rare disease. Dx was from a excisional biopsy on one of my submental nodes that was about 2.5cm nd round.

This disease is uncureable,  and frankly even my ent had never heard of it. It lines up as the only information online shows early kidney issues and eventually disease as a common complication and i have some protein passing already. Total 5 lymph nodes, only in neck to my knowledge through mri nd ct, largest being on my parotid measuring almost 3.5cm and 2 on my jugular. It is alittle disheartening to accept that i can only control for this as apparently even after excision, they will likely return, along with the kidney, salivary gland and lung complications. Not really willing to accept surgeries and steriods for long term periods or even life. The pathology report shows no information under microscopic description as my core needle biopsies did, just under dx it says Kimuras disease. He has now asked me to return in a month so he can gather more info and try to help me. Even resources on it are rare, no clinical trials or patient organizations on the western side.

The clinic I work at treats hep c for the imoverished.  We have a grant that covers labs and testing but there are co pays required. 

Steps to treatment include viral load measurement and genotype. Then staging with a biopsy or fibrosure blood test. We also have to determine if you have de compensated or compensated cirrhosis if your liver disease falls into that category (biopsy results dictate thus). Lastly you have to demonstrate compliance with therapy including no alcohol for the rest of your life, no drugs, and following up as instructed.

I no longer take this and when I initially stopped I found my heartrate returned to normal and would get quite low during sleep (which is what we all want, right?)

Factors potentially affecting it:

\-Eating carbs consistently for the first time in years (it's been 2 weeks, the heart thing started before that)

\-Little movement in general. Normally get my 10k steps without any difficulties.

"Hi there! I'm currently 23f and three years out from a stroke. I had a stroke caused by an Arteriovenous Malformation when I was 20 and have been making a really great recovery. That said, the stroke caused me to go significantly deaf in one ear. 

As far as I know, the nerve was damaged (but doctors never determined whether the stroke caused it directly or if the subsequent angiograms and embolizations were the issue). Understandably, I wasn't lucid for the early days of my hospitalization, but finally came around once my surgeries had started. After that, I noticed the hearing loss.

But since I was pretty unresponsive immediately after the stroke, they didn't determine exactly when it happened. My parents were with me and said that the doctors blamed the nerve in my ear, but I don't remember ever being informed of a cause.

I followed up with a few audiologists -- all of whom simply confirmed that, yes, I have hearing loss, but no, they don't know why.

I decided to look into some clinical studies. I want my hearing back more than anything. I was a musician before this whole thing happened. I got a hearing aid, but it didn't help much -- the lost frequencies were lower than most hearing aids even bother with.

I've been looking at clinical trials through nih.gov's deafness department's resources. But after looking, I realized that I don't even know what I'm looking for...

It could even be stage 4 melanoma that has metastasized to lungs and brain 

Anyhow, I’m sorry to tell you but her chances of survival are much much lower than your average person with cancer that hasn’t metastasized to the brain. Think somewhere along the lines of 5% or less

Depending on how aggressive the cancer is, she might have a few months left to live if the tumor is inoperable. 

If it is operable and it isn’t aggressive, she might be able to push out quite a few more time and possibly, if lucky, see remission through proper treatment. But the odds are against her at this point.

"I am a male, 25, white, 5'6, 120 lb's.

I have crohns disease and am in the middle of a terrible flare. I'm in a very annoying amount of pain (~5-6 on pain scale).

I cannot take prednisone or encort because I just started on a new clinical trial...it won't help for a couple of months at best.  I've tried remicade, humira, 6mp, methotrexate, pentasa....he thinks this is my best shot.  So I'm stuck with terrible pain that I can't get rid of and they want me to sit through for months....

I've been looking into pain management as an option since my GI won't give me pain medication. I've seen 2 family doctors both denied my request, the 3rd just gave me a anti-depressant and told me to come back in two weeks.

Could the ER refer me?  Although for insurance my PCP has to be the one to do it.

I'm lost at what to do. I can't work, I can't enjoy activities. Do I have any options?

"That's tricky. I don't have access to the clinical trial protocol, so I can't see what the maximum allowed steroid dose is for the study. You should ask your GI whether 20 mg is the maximum allowed dose for the study, or if there is some wiggle room. Did the bentyl and the tramadol help at all? I understand why your GI won't prescribe you long-term opiates, since they don't solve the problem and you develop a tolerance quite quickly. But the Bentyl shouldn't be a problem if that helps. 

Is this the study you are participating in: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT02520284 ? Sounds like steroids are not forbidden during the trial.

"Yes that is the trial.  Steroids are allowed but he wouldn't give me more than 20mg per day and that wasn't enough to help.  So he said you might as well not take them and start the trial without.  You have to either be on the steroids at the start of the trial and stay that way, or off them at the start and stay that way....they don't allow you to randomly start taking it in the middle.

My pain is mostly just dull burning pain that range from 5-6 and sometimes jumps up briefly to an 8.  I don't have cramps often so the bentyl doesn't really help, and the Tramadol has almost no effect on the pain and makes me feel dizzy/irrationally angry, and more depressed.

I have no plan on being on them for a large amount of time, I just need something until one of these meds kick in.  Not being able to work isn't going to fly for very long.  I did just apply for disability though.

"I ask this because I am a 29 year old 6 foot 3, 250lb male who was born with unsually loose joints. This affects my knees in such a way that they are in constant danger of sliding out of place. The knee cap can be moved around a circumference of about 5-7 inches. It looks gross to most people. Lifting weights with the legs such as a quad flex machine causes the knee cap to slip out to the side once the knee is bent at a 45 degree angle. My knee caps are eroding away with every step. A kick to the side of the knee would easily hyperextend the joints and cause intense pain. Walking up and down stairs is very painful and a loud crunch/crackle can be heard when bending the knees. Most importantly I can no longer run or jump, so therefore it has become harder and harder to loose weight which im sure would help dramatically with the pain. Workouts can become extremely dull when you used to be able to do p90x and now you are limited to an elliptical or stationary bike.  Anyway I am an ICU nurse on my feet a lot and I honestly dont know how much longer I will be able to walk if this pace continues. So I am desperate. Every orthopedic surgeon says my only option is knee replacement. I am way too young for a knee replacement and I never want one if I can help it.

"Hello!

I’m a 23/F, I’ve had Crohn’s disease since I was 13 years old. Last year (April/‘21) I had urgent surgery for a total colectomy and to place a stoma for an ileostomy. I have a small rectal stump, and they had to take about 8 inches of my small bowel in addition to my colon. It was a horrible experience that almost ended fatally several times, I was hospitalized for months. 

I needed surgery as my body has persistently built up antibodies to every medicinal treatment available to me, over the past ten years. About 6 after my surgery, after removing the entire disease portion of my bowel, I was only taking pantaloc (as instructed) and ended up having a Crohns flare up in my stomach and upper small bowel. At that point, they put me on methotrexate and Humira (they were hesitant to put me on Humira before, the only drug I hadn’t tried, as I was previously on it’s sister drug Remicade and had a “lupus-like reaction). This combination worked great (despite the not-so great side effects), and within months they cut my methotrexate dose in half. My number from my fecal-calprotectin test results were better than ever. 

Last week, I had a routine scope procedure. They found inflammation in my stomach, yet again, and now I have been prescribed Humira once weekly (rather than once bi-weekly). This has me worried as it’s a similar story to what happened with my past medications- they work for a year, if that, then I start to flare, then my dose in increased, and within the next year the drug will fail all together. 

My worry is regarding what’s next for me. What do they do when I’ve run out of options for medications? We’ve (my specialist) tried applying to clinical trials, and I’m declined every time. Will it mean more surgery? Certainly steroids. Gastrectomy? TPN? Feeding tube? I’m scared, but having SOME kind of idea of that possible outcomes for the future helps to ease my anxiety. 

I know this is kind of a complex question and situation, I appreciate anyone taking the time to read or leave me a comment. Thank you ❤️",1,hello f crohn disease since year old last year april urgent surgery total colectomy place stoma ileostomy small rectal stump take inch small bowel addition colon horrible experience almost ended fatally several time hospitalized month needed surgery body persistently built antibody every medicinal treatment available past ten year surgery removing entire disease portion bowel taking pantaloc instructed ended crohn flare stomach upper small bowel point put methotrexate humira hesitant put humira drug tried previously sister drug remicade lupus like reaction combination worked great despite great side effect within month cut methotrexate dose half number fecal calprotectin test result better ever last week routine scope procedure found inflammation stomach yet prescribed humira weekly rather bi weekly worried similar story happened past medication work year start flare dose increased within next year drug fail together worry regarding next run option medication specialist tried applying clinical trial declined every time mean surgery certainly steroid gastrectomy tpn feeding tube scared kind idea possible outcome future help ease anxiety know kind complex question situation appreciate anyone taking time read leave comment thank,fear
"This is a very complex situation, as you said so yourself and there's no right answer. Any of those options you presented are possible including clinical trials and definitively making sure you have exhausted all medications.

"39 F, 5’2”, 107 lbs, no medications at the moment aside from Ketoconazole shampoo

Current symptoms:

Episodes of moderate delirium (where it feels like I’m heavily intoxicated or just had a mTBI), problems with seeing clearly / tracking objects, head pressure and/or headaches, head tingling, sometimes muscle weakness, issues absorbing information, and serious issues with memory (forming and accessing). These episodes are occurring daily and last for several hours but not the entire day. Otherwise, I experience moderate brain fog. I feel like I have amnesia. I can’t form or access memories – even important events like my wedding. I also can’t complete complex tasks.

My pre-existing neurological issues got worse 2 weeks ago, with the worst symptoms being immediately after:

1. Visiting beach in Sarasota for 2 days (exposure to Red Tide)
2. Exposure to moldy orange in bedroom for 1 week (forgot about it due episodes with memory impairment)
3. Tinea capitis – currently treating with Ketoconazole shampoo

Since June, I’ve really struggled with extreme anxiety, depersonalization, derealization, visual snow, floaters, difficulty tracking objects (binocular vision dysfunction), extreme sensitivity to medication, cognitive decline/brain fog, and memory. All of this happened after doing psychedelics. I was in a clinical trial for psilocybin for treatment resistant depression and then did mushrooms on my own with a guide. I also took prescription ketamine a week later.

Diagnosis given in June: Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder, Anxiety, Depression

Other potential risk factors:

COVID (2022)

Concussion and post-concussion syndrome (2020) – binocular dysfunction after concussion

Breast implants (2013)

Marlex surgical mesh (since recalled from market) (2010)

Sleep apnea – treated with CPAP machine

Antidepressants taken from 14-38 years old; my body won’t tolerate them any longer after taking psychedelics.

Random episode of exercise-induced Rhabdomyolysis (2015)

For years, I’ve noticed issues related to concentration, memory, executive functioning, dry skin and hair, rashes, mood. Even a few years ago, I would complain I couldn't remember huge chunks of my life – like anything I studied in school – whether in my BA, MA, or PhD.

Is it possible that my system was in a state of inflammation when I did the psychedelics (from COVID, previous concussion and foreign objects/Autoimmune Syndrome Induced by Adjuvants), which started the neurological issues? Then exposure to red tide/mold amplified things? I haven’t gone to the emergency room, but I’ve debated it a few times. I don’t have a neurology appointment until April – he’s impossible to see before then.

I’ve seen a neurologist, rheumatologist, psychiatrist, and my family doctor.

My MRI from last week came back clear aside from mild mucosal thickening; I have an MRI with contrast booked, but I don’t want to do it if I don’t have to. Because my brain is so sensitive to any medication or supplement, I worry about the contrast agent.

Recent basic blood work is normal; blood work done by rheumatologist several months ago was normal as well.

"31F (5'5"" 155lbs) diagnosed with AATD about 2 years ago (Pi\*ZZ, AAT level in the high 20s). Imaging earlier this year shows chronic bronchitis and very early stage emphysema. Mostly asymptomatic except for some SOB, and persistent feeling of mucous in the back of my throat. Doc doesn't think I need AAT infusions for another 5-10 years. Abdominal ultrasound showed a slightly enlarged (16.9cm) heterogeneous and hyperechoic liver, enlarged spleen, and two very small (2mm) polyps or adhered gallstones in the gallbladder. My Alpha 1 doc does lungs, so she referred me to a liver doc to follow up on the ultrasound findings, but that appointment isn't until June 2. Back in January and February, I participated in a clinical trial for a new oral alpha 1 med that had raised liver levels as a potential side effect, but my levels were checked weekly and were normal.

Now my question: Starting about 2 weeks ago, I developed a pain in the upper right part of my abdomen the morning after having one cocktail, half a glass of wine, and a rich restaurant meal to celebrate a family member's birthday. (I generally limit drinking to less than 1 drink a week, which the doc has said is totally fine, so this was a bit more than normal). The pain is kind of a heavy/dull pain and the area is somewhat tender to the touch, but if I sneeze or move weirdly, it becomes a more stabbing/sharp pain. My guess is that it's gallbladder related, and my current plan is to just completely avoid fatty foods and alcohol and wait until I see the specialist in a little over a month, unless the pain gets unbearable. Does this seem reasonable? I don't want to waste resources with any unnecessary doc/urgent care/ER visits, but I also don't want to ignore a potential issue.

"LDL builds plaque, HDL will clear plaque. With that said, it is extremely rare (but possible) for individuals to have a higher HDL than LDL, which would have a role in clearing plaque from arteries. While statins will provide a significant reduction in LDL, it is unlikely that use of any drugs will clear plaque in most of the population. 

There are surgical methods of removing plaque, but they not typically used until urgently needed. 

The best way to preserve your cardiovascular function is to have a lipid profile performed (taking statins if needed), and exercising regularly. The standard focus is maintaining function and preventing decline, rather than trying to fix the problem.

"You need a 70% or better stenosis before the volume of blood flow is affected.  This is why most focus is on controlling the plaques rather than erasing them. When they get to 70% or more and are causing symptoms, then surgical intervention is warranted.  It is not warranted before that because of the complications associated with procedures like endarterectomies.   Studies in the Viet Nam war era showed on autopsy 18 year young men were already showing early signs of plaque formation.  Some of it is lifestyle, diet and exercise, a good portion of it is genetics.  

If you have elevated cholesterol and you have other risk factors for heart disease then adding a statin to the mix can be helpful.  They are thought to stabilize the plaques so there are no acute ruptures, causing stroke or heart attack.  They also have an anti inflammatory effect (which is also one of the benefits of aspirin).  There are studies out there showing actual reversal of plaques with intensive enough treatment.

"26M Dx Hypersomnia 
Medicine prescribed: solfeggio frequencies from youtube and an $850 product for cranial electrical stimulation

Hello, I suffer from a life-debilitating sleep disorder. Had a sleep study just recently and received a diagnosis of Hypersomnia, which i was told meant “we dont know the cause but you are verifiably tired” by the Doctor.


Summary:
—————

I only sleep four hours a night.
(It was recorded for 2 weeks prior to my sleep study for clarity)

This has been a vicious cycle for more than 5 years now, but to clarify i’ve always had sleeping issues from birth like sleepwalking until 14yo, comatose depth levels of sleep. 
(It could be approaching ten years if not more but my memory has just been getting worse from the huge lack of sleep.)

I am coming from a history of graveyard shift work, but faced a layoff a few months ago and have been attempting to  approach this from a day shift schedule. The sleep problems have been the same. It takes forever for me to sleep, if i do, and whenever I do, within a 24hour period, i only sleep a maximum of four hours. There are days where i get none at all and the following day is still a maximum of four hours.

The only way i was able to take the Sleep study was by a prescribed sleep-aid of xanax due to the test requiring a minimum of six hours of rest. (and it did help me get to the six hour mark thankfully)

I’ve come to this sub to ask about CES and opinions going forward.

Following the science, there have only been 2 randomized clinical trials done regarding CES (cranial electrical stimulation) specifically for insomnia;

one from 1940, and the other in 2012, using the exact product this doctor is wanting me to rent from them:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493135/

Although it is an “FDA approved” product, the summary of one very old and one more modern RCT do not provide evidence supporting the efficacy of CES for decreasing the symptoms of insomnia compared to usual care.

Upon reading this, I’m worried I have a doctor who is just trying to get a dollar out of me rather than help me at all try to sleep.

To steel-man the doctors position, in the case of conditioned insomnia, its best to retrain the brain rather than risk medical dependency. I’m 100% for any solution, whether it requires a machine to zap my ears or to listen to a certain hz, i just want help.

But if my doctor doesnt know the cause, and he see’s data showing I’m barley operating through exhaustion, would your recommendation be to spend 800 USD on a machine and check back in another month? (That studies show offer no results for insomnia)

"Hi,

My friend M 28 has a tumor in his brain and unfortunately there's not much hope. He's on intensive care. The tumor isn't localized and has now covered 55% of his brain. The docs have given up on him. It was a series of wrong decisions to reach this stage. He a had a tumor removed before this one 2 years ago and probably they missed a tiny chunk of malignant cells in that procedure. Steps taken after detecting this second tumor were devastating on him. 

The parents are holding on to some hope /miracle and are looking into trying alternative meds like dr Bryzinski in Texas. Of course, I'm not buying into the idea and don't feel like breaking their hope. The patient isn't eligible for clinical trials which I feel is unfair.

Do you have any suggestions for procedures used in Europe but not in the US. He's currently in one of the best hospitals in the country : Brigham and women's hospital.

"I understand your wish to try anything to bring your friend back to health, but 55%  of his brain has been affected. That's at least 55% of his brain you'd never be able to get back. Your friend is in the intensive care unit, which means he is very very critically ill. He likely has very little time to live. There are no therapies that can heal his brain. Even if you found a true miracle to get rid of the cancer he has now, he would be left with 45% of his brain, and all the problems that comes with. Dr. Bryzinski's therapies could not help him now, even if they did work (which is unlikely). It's simply too late in the disease to consider something like that. 

Your friend's family has a chance to give him a loving and peaceful transition into whatever comes after this world. Not everyone gets that chance. If he doesn't have it already, they should be working very closely with palliative and (it sounds like) hospice care. I'm so sorry this is happening, it's a true tragedy. I hope you find peace.

"My father has Stage 4 cholangiocarcinoma. He tried chemo (5-F4 and oxaliplatin) and it shrunk the tumors in his nodes, bone (hip area) and liver. After five months of chemo, the liver tumors have stopped responding and started to grow once more. 

His doctor is now having him try more chemo (irinotecan and gemzar). They said there is a 20% chance the new chemo will work. After trying six cycles (about 6 months) of that, they plan to try radiation beads in his groin area. The last and final option is a clinical trial drug (Taxanes - paclitaxel/Taxol) and docetaxel/Taxotere).

My father is 57 years old. He won't ask the doctors the hard question of how much time he has left because he said he is not ready to process the information. I would like to prepare myself as best I can and wonder if there are any medical professionals out there who can offer their professional opinion.

"I'm sorry to hear about your father and I have no idea about length of time, I agree with tcc1 that you should really talk with your doctor and father about end of life decisions etc. I did want to offer some input I hope you will find valuable. 

My father was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma over 5 years ago. He went through traditional chemo and was given percentages about success rate etc. It left everyone in the family with a rather hopeless feeling. Do the chemo, take the drugs, and cross your fingers and hope they work. Didn't give us any control.

What his doctors didn't tell us and what we discovered through our own research (mother is an MD as well) is that what you eat and your lifestyle can have a profound impact on many types of cancers (and other diseases as well). In addition to his chemo and drugs we had him drastically change what he was eating (juicing,  A LOT more vegetables, way less sugar etc) and his lifestyle to actively help fight the disease. Five years later and he's 100% cancer free and no sign of remission.

Again, my father had an entirely different type of cancer not saying it will increase his life expectancy with this type of cancer but it does give you a sense of control and another tool to help fight the cancer. I think it's important to have every tool available to you to help fight the disease and often times we leave out the nutrition and lifestyle part when it can have a large influence.

I can recommend some reading on the topic if you are interested.

"It's a hard subject to bring up and how you communicate it is going to be different based on personality types. My dad was relatively open to trying anything that improved his chances so it was relatively easy.

For many people, possibly fatal cancer is the red flag that makes people realize 'hey, this is it...I have to make a change or I might not be around to see my grand kids grow up (or whatever else they enjoy).' I've met many others where even a heart attack or cancer Dx isn't enough to get them to change.

I would just try to remind your dad that there are things he can control and that if he is truly dedicated to beating this disease he's going to have to change. It'll be hard, but it'll be worth it.

"**Basic information**

* 36F, 5'5"", 120lbs, white
* Never smoked

**Health summary**

* Advanced melanoma (initial skin lesion removed in 2012; found three metastases in 2019, all in the upper chest... mediastinal; one in chest vanished during immunotherapy, the others are growing; two ""surprise"" \[though not entirely based on PET\] removed in a partial \[about 12"", I think\] small bowel resection, leaving only the two more or less confirmed tumors)
* Misc. GI related issues (food intolerances that come and go)
* Immunotherapy-caused hypothyroidism (finally under control with levothyroxine)
* Paraneoplastic symdrome (suspected, anyways; neurological manifestations)
* Intussusception (July, 2021)

**Primary complaint**

* Periodically experiencing low blood pressure at rest (sleeping, sitting, laying down) - dizzy, feeling like passing out/""blacking"" out, etc.  Standing/movement helps.

**Medications**

* Some supplements (vitamin D, magnesium)
* \~100mcg levothyroxine
* Clinical trial study drug for cancer (ASTX029)

**Verbose novel :)**

My wife has a number of medical issues... most notably, advanced melanoma (on a phase 1 trial for that, after disease progression began again while on immunotherapy). She also reacts strongly and often negatively to drugs (both allergic reactions and just not tolerating things well, even something like levothyroxine formulations... finally found Tirosint-SOL, but still had to \*very\* slowly increase the dose). She was hypothyroid for quite a while (TSH got up to around 130) due to the immunotherapy. She also has food intolerances, long-lasting GI issues that come and go, etc. Caffeine and theobromine, as a random aside, are really not good things; she has not eaten chocolate for many years, now.

The melanoma seems to have also caused paraneoplastic syndrome, particularly with her vision. Not particularly conclusively diagnosed, but that's what the neurologist's best guess was for some of her neurological symptoms (again, particularly vision related).

Her bloodwork tends to be fine (some abnormalities, tends to be anemic based on hemoglobin counts, but overall nobody tends to raise eyebrows there), her numerous ECGs and echocardiograms always come back as normal.

So, with all that as a backdrop, what I'm actually looking for is ideas around what could cause hypotension ... but not orthostatic hypotension; she tends to get low BP when she's laying down and asleep, but low enough that her chest starts to hurt, she feels dizzy or like passing out, etc. It tends to get better when she stands up, though not necessarily dramatically. She did have orthostatic hypotension in a recent hospital visit for a bowel obstruction (presumably caused by adhesions from an anastomosis ... intussusception in July, caused by a melanoma nodule), and this is definitely not the same.

It is worth noting that her normal BP is something like 95-105/65-75. Mid-90s/mid-60s is fairly normal as well. Once it gets below 90/60, she starts to feel off. I believe it's gone below 80/50 a couple times.

It has come and gone in the past couple years. It's ""come"" again, so ... back to trying to find causes! Some ideas that we've had:

* Changes in salt intake (post bowl obstruction diet is quite different; we eat mostly homemade stuff, so we likely eat way less salt than the typical American, for what that's worth). I've also read that ""you can raise BP with salt"" may not exactly be true, but :)
* Changes in exercise (this particular instance came up after the most recent hospital stay; we tried exercising more regularly \[walks\] back when it was a thing a year ago, but I can't remember how that panned out exactly)
* ???

"**Propecia** and **finasteride** are the go-to drug to prescribe for male hair loss, but the biological/medical effects of altering one's hormones through **DHT** suppression seem relatively unexplored, or unexplained

Alongside internet rants of permanent side effects (or **post-fin syndrome**), even ones aside from libido loss and ED, which include weight gain, rapid-aging, gyno or even lactation, it's easier to dismiss the other side that cites safety through clinical trials which are more than likely paid for by **pharmaceutical companies** promoting their expensive drug.

It's harder to weigh up opinions on the internet which will be the extremes of two sides (probably vastly different from your average patient)

Obviously **all drugs have potential side effects**, but would you say the ones from fin/pro are more potent or likely than the side effects of other normally prescribed drugs?

White  
Duration: Entire life  
Medical Issues: HS  
No medications  


So ever since I was little, I have had a really low threshold for fainting. For example:  


* At age 3, I fainted over receiving a finger prick hemoglobin test
* At  age 11, I fainted when I cut my finger on the lid on a can of tuna. This instance I was out for over 10 minutes.
* At age 14, I nearly fainted when I burnt my hand (2nd degree). I prevented this by laying on the floor. 
* At age 21, I fainted after receiving an improperly placed IV prior to surgery. I was laying in a hospital bed. 
* At age 30, I fainted after trying to get my blood drawn by an inexperienced phlebotomist. He missed the vein and I was out. I was in a sitting position.   


I've have other instances I can think of where I would have fainted, but I quickly learned if I cut myself, to simply apply pressure to the cut and lay on the floor until the ""wave"" sensation and ringing in my ears dissipates. Then I apply first aid.  I have also noticed that this seems to only be an issue if I cut myself on my hands or lower arms, plus the above medical procedures. If I cut or injure myself anywhere else, I do not feel the sensation I am about to faint. I should also note that I have no fear of needles and no fear of IVs or getting blood drawn. I have had both happen successfully many times without anxiety. The fainting and sensation of about to faint only seems to happen during an improper insertion or when the needle hits the vein wall.   


I'm hoping to participate in a clinical trial but I must have my blood drawn on a varying weekly to monthly basis. We were unsuccessful to get blood at the first meeting because of my fainting and small veins. I don't want to put myself through bad blood draws and potentially develop a complex, but if every blood draw is like today, I can't go through with the trial. Is there anything I can do to help mediate this and make it easier for someone to draw blood? Is there anything I can do to lessen the chance of fainting or is it simply a ""quirk"" of my body?

"Full disclosure, if you don’t tell someone, that makes it worse. I have had a patient where he was talking in complete sentences, and when i stuck the needle in, he screamed and yanked his arm away which puts him at risk for further injury and me at risk for a potential stick. If you are as bad as you say you are, let someone know! Depending on where this is occurring, they could have you in a bed or on the floor or in a different position so that you’re more relaxed. One of the best things to do is to not think about it (harder than it sounds, I know). Talk to your phlebotomist or have someone there that you can talk to during the draws! Maybe you call someone on the phone or put on some music or Netflix? Try holding a stress ball or something in the other arm/hand.

"My grandma, 82 F, 5'1"", 105 lbs. Non smoker, no second-hand smoke, healthy life style, active. Since April my grandma has had some breathing problems. She would be out of breath going uphill on her daily walks. In May she went to the doctor and got an X-ray done. Showed a little bit of groundglass opacity in the left lung. Was told it's probably pneumonia (no other symptoms), got two types of antibiotics. Felt a little better, follow up scan said same thing. Did breathing exercises to try and help with lung mobility. In the beginning of July we went to the ER, she probably caught a cold, and had a fever and low oxygen, around 90-93. She got more scans there, oxygen, got prescribed really strong antibiotics, discharged. After these antibiotics, she started coughing up clear/frothy fluid. She felt a little better and in mid July we did a bronchoscopy. No viruses, no bacteria, no fungi, some unclear atypical cells with enlarged nuclei that COULD be cancer, or could be just inflammatory processes. After the bronchoscopy, she was very weak for about a month. We were offered a puncture biopsy, but she was very physically out of it. He doctors also said there was a 30-40% chance of lung collapse. Finally we coaxed her into getting a biopsy, scheduled for mid September. She lost 7-10 pounds. Beginning of September we took her to the ER because she said she felt unwell. Oxygen at 87-94. The hospital melts her, and expedited her biopsy. Loads of CT scans, and X-rays after biopsy. Still coughing up mucus. Her lung collapsed. Reinflated and biopsy came back confirming adenocarcinoma. Her CT scan said possibility of a couple types of pneumonia, or some mucinous adenocarcinoma. Had a talk with her doctor today. He said he doesn't need the upcoming MRI or bone scan (looking for metastasis) to confirm that it is stage 4 because it's spreading withing her lungs (like a sponge, and a couple nodules). Surgery is out.

Does this mean this is an aggressive cancer? He said 3-4 months tops, I'm just not sure what will be happening to her. Will she die because she will suffocate? I've seen seniors go through chemo, but apparently she's too weak, I'm not knowledgeable in how tough chemo is. Is the cancer eating up and replacing her lung tissues? And if it went from April to now, that bad, how long might she have had this for? This is so sudden for a person who lived a clean life, I'm now worried about genetics. Would doing clinical trials be good for her? Is there even a point? How could something so horrifying and destructive evolve so fast?

"It's always hard to tell if a new symptom is related to a new medication or if it's a coincidence, especially if it's a side effect that isn't common to that particular medication.

If you look at the monograph for Montelukast, the initial clinical trials before the drug came to market don't actually list any psychiatric side effects like anxiety as a potential side effect.

But the monograph also has included a post-marketing warning (side effects reported by the public and physicians after a drug has been approved) that there are reports of neuropsychiatric side effects from Montelukast which does include reports of anxiety and doctors are advised to monitor their patients for this.

This study seems to suggest that reported anxiety symptoms from montelukast are very rare.  Less than 3% of patients in all studies reported any mood symptoms and it's interesting to note that 2% of patients taking placebo (no montelukast) also reported these same symptoms.  As well, only 1 in 3,000 patients had a mood symptom that was defined as ""serious""

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19815116

As well, montelukast reaches peak levels in the body between 1-9 hours after a dose, so any side effects are theoretically possible within this interval even with the first dose.  Your doctor may be referring to the principle that a once-daily medication like montelukast usually needs about 5 days of treatment to reach steady levels in the body to start having its full effect.",5,always hard tell new symptom related new medication coincidence especially side effect common particular medication look monograph montelukast initial clinical trial drug came market actually list psychiatric side effect like anxiety potential side effect monograph also included post marketing warning side effect reported public physician drug approved report neuropsychiatric side effect montelukast include report anxiety doctor advised monitor patient study seems suggest reported anxiety symptom montelukast rare le patient study reported mood symptom interesting note patient taking placebo montelukast also reported symptom well patient mood symptom defined serious well montelukast reach peak level body hour dose side effect theoretically possible within interval even first dose doctor may referring principle daily medication like montelukast usually need day treatment reach steady level body start full effect,joy
"Thanks for the response, and the included data. It's difficult to rationalize the severe panic attack as a coincidence, given no other significant changes in environment or diet/medication. However, given the statistics, I can see the unlikelihood.

Recognizing fully that it is perhaps not the rational or doctor's favorite decision: I think going forward my mother's most likely course of action is to seek alternative treatments (to montelukast), as best case scenario with montelukast going forward is a week of obsessively hoping a new panic attack does not occur, before having it work well or not.",1,thanks response included data difficult rationalize severe panic attack coincidence given significant change environment diet medication however given statistic see unlikelihood recognizing fully perhaps rational doctor favorite decision think going forward mother likely course action seek alternative treatment montelukast best case scenario montelukast going forward week obsessively hoping new panic attack occur work well,joy
"I think that's certainly a rational approach.

Discussing a repeat trial of the medication with her doctor is a reasonable option if she is willing, as the likelihood that it was the medication is low, and if it happens again, it might be unpleasant, but shouldn't be dangerous and should be reversible with stoppling again.

"39, F, Idaho. 

I have chronic headaches that nothing seems to touch. I’m not going to go into it again because it’s long but I posted about it [here. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/d30561/headaches_ive_tried_everything_or_so_it_feels_and/) If you have any suggestions I’d love to hear about it but this post is about something else. 

Can my doctor prescribe ketamine for home use? Could I ask him to show me how to start an IV?

I’ve tried everything except ketamine and Botox.   Botox is a massive PIA to get approved by my insurance and there’s several more months of hoops I would have to go through. I was on the waitlist for 4 months for a headache specialist and he suddenly left the practice. 2 other headache specialists have left the area. I’m in the process on getting on the waitlist for another one but he’s booking out 4 months as well. I’m tired of my head hurting and feeling awful. 


I’ve been reading about ketamine and there was a small study [for migraines. ](https://thejournalofheadacheandpain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s10194-016-0700-3) There’s also an ongoing [clinical trial. ](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03896256)

I’m really interested but the closest clinic to me is $500 an IV with a suggested 6 treatments so $3,000 and of course not covered by insurance. Other clinics charge $350 an IV or so but require plane tickets and rental cars so it’s a wash. No idea why my local one is that much more. And it’s not really local. It’s 90 minutes away and you need to be driven home so it’s also at least a half day off work for my husband x6. 

But if I can get ketamine from Caremark for $48 and it’s enough for 2 IVs based on my weight. 

So $144 plus IV supplies for 6 treatments vs $3,000. 

And if I get it from Walmart (I’m assuming they would have to special order it) I have $0 co-pay so it would just be the IV supplies. 

I live in and small town and I’m friends with my pain doctor. Like go out to dinner with his wife and my husband kind of friends. We have been to each other’s houses, etc. He’s an anesthesiologist with a pain focus. He’s done trigger point injections on my back and another injection in my neck to try to help with the headaches. 

He’s not a partner in his practice and the owner isn’t interested in any kind of IVs. 

I know there are weird laws about what doctors can and can’t do outside a clinical setting. Like I know my ob/gyn friend can’t attend a home birth. 

**I don’t want to ask him to do anything illegal that I might not know is illegal so I’m asking here first.**

I know you won’t probably know Idaho laws specifically and it’s the Wild West out here. Really strict in some ways (hardest state for telemedicine) and lenient in others (pharmacists can prescribe antibiotics for certain things, etc) but in general can you give me some ideas? 

I’m also open to paying a home health nurse. My father-in-law is a med tech and was a phlebotomist in the Army. I could also ask him to show me how to start an IV. He says I have good veins. 



1.  Can my doctor prescribe ketamine for home use?
2. Can he teach me how to start an IV?
3. Could a home health nurse do the IV?
4. Is he allowed to do the IV at my house (or his) outside the clinic?
5. Can he get the IV supplies for me? 
6. What’s the best way for me to get this done?

Before you think I’m a crazy junkie, from what I’m reading the protocol for depression is 6 IVs in two weeks and then maybe a a booster in a few months. Some people never need a booster. There isn’t really a protocol for migraines. I’m happy to keep the ketamine at his house if he’s more comfortable. The dosage for this is a fraction of what people use to get high.

Weight: 165  
Race: White  
Current medications: Lamisil 250mg, OTC Antihistamines as needed for Allergies (Allegra and/or Zyrtec ***20mg***)  
Relevant Medical History (?): (10+ years ago) Spleen injury (rupture) from blunt force trauma. Was not removed.  

  
Today I went to the Doctor with a case of what I suspected was Athletes foot. I had been traveling and unable to treat for awhile so it had progressed to what I believe to be a moderate/severe state -- with the fungus creating an open wound on more than one occasion. I asked the doctor to prescribe something oral instead of a cream because of the inconveniences of using a cream at night/getting it on the bedsheets, etc, and my request was granted with a six week supply of Terbinafine 250mg once per day. A scraping was also taken for analysis, but I was told to begin treatment with the pills now instead of waiting for the findings to come back.

However, now that I have been reading about the possibility of side effects from Lamisil Oral, I can't help but think that I should be trying the cream first. I read online that 3.3%(!) of patients taking Lamisil Oral develop irregular liver enzyme levels and that 90% of these cases occur within the first month of treatment (info is from the original clinical trials). The clinical trial also stated that there was no difference in incidence between those who had underlying liver conditions and those who did not, but just for the record, I do not drink alcohol and am not on any other medications except for the Antihistamines I listed above. However, I am not sure how my liver was affected from the blunt force trauma incident listed above (scar tissue, etc). I feel a bit weird taking on this risk just because I don't want to deal with a cream -- but then again my doctor must think that it is ok as he prescribed the meds without even doing a liver panel.  

Do I need to be worried about this -- and, if so, should I discontinue use to try the cream first? If you recommend I continue, would it be overstepping to ask for a Liver Panel to make sure everything is going alright? How often could I ask for one without turning into ""that crazy patient?""

"Hi, docs.

Our six-month-old daughter is suffering from her first fever, and our pediatrician is treating as if it's influenza (Tamiflu and children's tylenol). A family friend who's an epidemiologist recommended we supplement the treatment with elderberry extract, and I was curious if anyone had any clinical experience with that in infants. Some brief pubmed searches showed a few clinical trials, but never in children, and never in terribly reputable journals.

Details:

* 6 months old, female, 18 lbs
* located in Massachusetts
* Fever spikes to 103.9, is moderately responsive to tylenol, and is highly variable throughout the day
* A cough has been present for about a week (~six days before the onset of the fever). The cough is infrequent, sounds productive, and mostly happens when transitioning from reclining to sitting or vice versa.
* Since the fever began, overall head congestion has worsened, but is still mild -- there's no runny nose.
* During times of high fever, baby is glassy-eyed and flushed, but still generally happy.
* Appetite is partially suppressed and there is an increased amount of sleep. She's eating about 2/3rds of her normal daily intake, and napping substantially more.
* In office rapid test for influenza was negative (though I realize that's not terribly indicative of a true negative)
* Respiration rate ranges from 40-70ish, depending on fever. Sp02 is 99%.
* Chest sounds are clear.
* No ear tugging or signs of inflammation.
* We've had the first flu vaccine, but have not yet had the 4-week booster.
* Currently treating with children's tylenol and tamiflu

Questions:

1) We're not terribly familiar with pediatrics. How common is it for other viruses besides influenza to cause fevers this high?

2) Is there anything else besides the flu we should be worried about?

3) Any thoughts on supplementing the current drugs with over-the-counter elderberry extract? I'm a scientist and have a healthy skepticism of NCAM treatments, but, at the same time, I don't want to be a medicine snob if there's actually reasonable data about efficacy.

"So I'm my grandmother's caregiver, medical power of attorney, etc. She's a white female, 76 y.o., 165lbs, 5'5"" and has been diagnosed with stage IV metastatic breast cancer since November of 2014. Pleural cavity, C6, C3, C7, pelvis, and liver are where the cancer has spread.

She's doing shockingly well. She's on a clinical trial, we've seen reduction in tumor size and pleural effusion volume. She has a pleurex catheter to drain the pleural effusion and volume in that space is kept to normal levels pretty consistently. 

However, she has a cough. It's bad, it just isn't getting any better. Some of it was from GERD, which we treat with pantoprazole. Some of it is from lifestyle, like how she likes to speak and eat and doesn't take her time chewing and swallowing. 

The issues I'd like addressed are twofold: 

1.) Where do we go after opioids and codeine antitussives? They don't seem to do much good. We have a humidifier to keep her air moist and that thing is cleaned thoroughly just short of autoclaving its parts every 3 days. 

2.) How on Earth do you drill it into an old woman's head that her chewing/swallowing/speaking habits are bad and she needs to re-evaluate to cut down on the cough? I sat with her for an hour last night, keeping her plate and fork from her until I was satisfied she had chewed and swallowed appropriately - no coughing fits! I let her manage for herself and she hacks like crazy.

"After you have explained the corollation between eating and coughing to her, the rest is up to her.  It will be difficult for her to change. She probably has ""studding"" of her pleura or diaphragm which triggers cough. If so, it is difficult to treat and unrelated to her habits. Has she tried benzonatate? What was the codeine dose? Please don't take on the role of drill sergeant. An older lady with ""bad"" habits who has terminal cancer should be left to enjoy the time she has. Who knows, it may bother you more than her if she accepts it as part of her disease process. One very important thing to do for her is discuss her end of life wishes.

"Much appreciated. Benzonatate does nothing, codeine dosage I can't recall but it was a moderate dose after lower dose didn't work so well. Still nothing. 

From reads on her scans, we don't have any pressure on her lungs aside from minor pleural effusion volume (200mL max) and no obvious collections of cancer cells adhering anywhere anymore. The GERD has improved tremendously with treatment. As to end of life wishes, we have everything squared away and ready- we did that within a month or so of diagnosis. It's been years now and it's just a thing in the back of our minds, not the forefront. 

I'm trying to help her enjoy herself more- fancy meals cooked at home, every day there's a bevvy of entertainment on a network drive and media PC, she loves snooping on people via facebook, and there's the Amazon Echo with all the music she could ever want. When she wants to go out, we go out and do whatever she wants. It's just that she gets ahead of herself on basic things like chewing and swallowing, getting up and walking on her own (she has poor balance but PT helps) without me there to watch her and prevent a fall, etc.

Hey all I'm a 33 y/o male, 71 kg, 182 cm.

Medical history:
I had a discotumy at L4-L5 surgery 12 years ago over a herniated disc. no symptoms after the prosidure.
No other serious medical conditions.
Recent bloodwork came out fine.

My story begins about 3 months ago, I had a serious health scare where I had intense upper back pain and thought I had herniated disc again, went for a whole back CT scan that showed 2 buldging disc at L4-L5 (again), L3-L4 and spondyliosysic changes at L5-S1. But upper back and neck were fine.
There was no pain or weakness in my legs so I wasn't worried about the findings in my lower back.

I was recommended to go see a chiropractor and to continue exercising.
I went back to my daily life, and within a few weeks the pain had gone away.

But as soon as the pain was gone I started having twitches all over my body, started with legs but shortly after it spread to everywhere in my body.
Also my right foot started to feel funny, cold sensations that are almost constant (even though it's warm to touch).

I started obsessing over the twitching and went to consult a neurologist, I told him about my symptoms and that I'm worried about ALS or other NMD, he did some clinical trials like reflex, strangh and some more, he concluded that I'm fine and referred me to an EMG to check for polyradiculopathy. I went and did the EMG and the results came back with some abnormalities (results attached)
I'm freaking out the last few days with anxiety and I'm worried I'm developing ALS.
Can anyone please help me understand if these results are normal for someone with my medical history or if there's any reason to be worried about? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated

Sorry if my grammar is off, English is not my native language.

To summarize :
Symptoms of body wide (and frequent) twitches and right foot altered sensation of cold feeling for about 6 weeks.
Abnormal emg attached.
No pain or weakness due to buldging disc.

I cannot take prednisone or encort because I just started on a new clinical trial...it won't help for a couple of months at best.

I have brought up the concerns with my GI doctor, after countless attempts at basically begging for something...he gave me an bentyl (for cramps) and a 20 day supply of Tramadol and said that's all I was getting. I also have about 8-10 bowel movements a day.

I've been looking into pain management as an option since my GI won't give me pain medication. I've seen 2 family doctors both denied my request, the 3rd just gave me a anti-depressant and told me to come back in two weeks.

Could the ER refer me? Although for insurance my PCP has to be the one to do it.

Race: White  

Duration of complaint: 4 years / 2 weeks  

Location on body: Feet and endocrine system  

Any diagnosed medical issues: PCOS, macular degeneration \(yes, really\)

Current medications and doses: Anti\-VEGF injections into eyeball, previously Metformin ER \(1500mg\)  and Zovia \(high dose\)  

any recreational drugs: none  

smoking status: Never tried it, no desire to  

Family history: Everybody has diabetes. Everyone.  

Problem:   

I have PCOS, first diagnosed 4 years ago, but I've been symptomatic for 10 years. I was diagnosed as part of a clinical trial, by high androgens and polycystic ovaries. 

The trial mostly involved taking metformin. After my participation concluded, my PCP agreed to prescribe metformin for me for PCOS, but not for prediabetes \- because even at my weight, my blood sugar and A1C were good \(mostly because of a low sugar diet\). 

After a few months, I noticed that I was experiencing tachycardia after eating. It didn't matter what I ate \- piece of steak, piece of celery, piece of cheese \- heart starts racing. I woke up late one morning and forget my metformin on the way out of the house, and didn't experience any tachycardia that day. I talked to my doctor and stopped metformin. Partially because the tachycardia was very uncomfortable, but also because the metformin wasn't helping me lose weight \(my actual goal\). The tachycardia did not re\-occur.

Still, everybody in my family has diabetes, so I get my A1C tested every physical \(yearly\). I still wasn't pre\-diabetic last year. I quit the Zovia last year, because babies.

For the last two weeks, I have been experiencing shallow skin numbness on both big toes, and the pad of the foot adjacent to them. After trying several different pairs of shoes, I do not think I can blame the numbness on shoes. 

I recently moved, and haven't seen my new PCP yet \(I'm about two months away from my physical\). I called to try and set up an earlier appointment because I am freaking out about diabetes, and I got ... not really a response. They'll call me if an appointment opens up. 

Should I be freaking out yet? I don't think an urgent care place would test my A1C, diagnose diabetes, and send me on my way with a metformin Rx, but I am concerned that waiting two months to start treating it isn't a healthy choice either.

"22F, 5’1, 110 lbs, No drug use, minimal alcohol consumption. 

I was diagnosed with a fibroid (~2x3 cm subserosal on the top of my uterus) and endometriosis via laparoscopy in November 2019 after experiencing severe pelvic pain for 1 year prior. The doctor didn’t take anything out because he said the fibroid “wasn’t big enough to cause problems” and the endo was on my round ligament and “only stage 1”. I have been taking Orilissa 150mg daily since last December. It worked for a while but the pain is back now. It has been at least a 7, usually higher, every day for the last five weeks and several times it’s been bad enough that I have vomited. I miss school frequently because I can’t stand up and walk because of the pain. I can’t have sex with my husband most days because it hurts. I feel pretty useless because all I can do is lay in bed and OTC pain meds don’t help (I’ve tried aleve, ibuprofen, Tylenol, and mixtures of those). 

At this point I don’t even know what to do and I don’t know if I have any other options at all. I had a doctor friend (not an OBGYN) look at the pictures from my surgery and she said she didn’t even see any endo anywhere and that the fibroid could be pushing on my rectum because of the position (it hurts worse when I have to poop so maybe?). I have the pictures, but don’t really want to post my uterus for the whole internet to see. I will dm them if anyone really wants to see them. 

Am I completely hopeless?? I am open to another surgery if it would help me. I’ve looked into clinical trials and there is one in my area (MT-2990) but it scares me that I might get the placebo.

"23 male, 180 lbs, 5’9” CA. Generally healthy. 

I’ll preface this by saying that this is the 3rd time I’ve been sick in the last 6 months and I’m absolutely furious about it. I try to do everything right; I wash my hands, eat generally healthy, try to cut out animal products, and recently started indoor biking. But I teach kids regularly and I’m always on the move. Being sick is by far my least favorite part of life. 


I’ve been reading about certain foods that are shown to trigger an immune response, notably some species of mushroom. They’re been shown in clinical trials to help fight off infection. My question is would it be wise to consume foods like that, say maitake mushroom, on a daily basis to keep the immune system in a constant state of high alertness? 


I can predict I’ll get some responses along the lines of “you idiot your immune system isn’t affected by food” or “stop trying to hack your body.” Well there is substantial evidence out there that certain substances such as glucans do in fact help the body deal with being sick. 


So should I stock up on foods that supposedly boost immune response, or save them for only when I’m feeling sick?

"I've been suffering from New Daily Persistent Headache (NDPH) for 3 years. I saw a psychiatrist because of the distress and misery it was causing me, after finally receiving a diagnosis 2 yrs later. I saw a headache specialist who prescribed Divalproex, saying ""Divalproex and Topamax are the only two options for treating NDPH"".

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6503587/

Following the case study in the link, I was able to convince my Psychiatrist to change my antidepressant from to Venlafaxine from Duloxetine, and I found helped reduce my headaches from NDPH far more than anything else I tried. It allowed me to get much more of my life back from this chronic condition.

I'm still not happy with the periodic subtle headaches I get that ""float"" over my head from time to time. I want to convince the headache specialist to prescribe a (TNF-α) inhibitor like the study mentions, theorizing that the headaches are caused by inflammation of the (CNS). 

She already is hesitant to my previous suggestions of looking for clinical trials to participate in, and is confident in herself that Divalproex and Topamax can work, despite mentioning only 1/2 of patients get relief from NDPH by using them, often with potent side effects.

Is there any way I can get my headache specialist to prescribe a medication that could potentially help me further, when I saw sucess with another medication that works similarly to other (TNF-α) inhibitors? I realize that I'm playing doctor by suggesting unproven, experimental treatments, however I feel it could honestly help me reduce my daily headaches which still play a massive role in my day to day life.

I do have minor cervical spinal stenosis, but physical therapy, nor acupuncture, nor chiropractic relief has helped reduce it.

"Hello all,

My mom (67 white female, 5'2"", 180 lbs) has had a severe allergic reaction to heat and exercise ever since I can remember (I'm talking I've seen her go into anaphylaxis multiple times in my life when the temp creeped above 80 degrees, has to carry epi pen). A few years ago I heard about systemic mastocytosis (SM) while transcribing a clinical trial for medication to treat it and strongly suspected this disease and urged her to get tested for it. At the time, she had no insurance, and she couldn't do it. Now she is on Medicaid, but she wanted to handle her heart failure (dxd in 2015) before that bc her symptoms have been decently controlled with Zyrtec and Mucinex, and tylenol3 for pain (she took one pill before bed each night).

She was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 2021 during a stent surgery, and the heart surgeon in her city referred her to Mayo Clinic in Rochester. Surgery by Dr. Schaff, who performed a septal and apical myectomy that went perfectly until about three hours after waking up in ICU. she started to experience thickening mucus that blocked her airway and a narrowing airway. She said she couldn't breathe and asked for Zyrtec to ward off a major reaction that was starting. All her major vitals were in normal limits, and her nurses chalked it up to an anxiety attack (at this point no SM dx. I told every nurse about her allergy to heat and stress and exercise, but I guess since she had no dx they didn't look into it? Idk). She complained of symptoms of a reaction **constantly throughout her five-day stay** until discharge. The follow-up doc urged her to get an appt with an immunologist ASAP. She continued to get worse while we waited for follow up.

We saw a doctor at Mary Bright a few days after discharge for flow up, and by this time my mom was doing so poorly that it seemed like she had never had the procedure at all. She couldn't walk across the room without practically dying. The follow-up doc agreed she *may very well have SM* (she emphasized this in her note), did a chest x-ray, and discovered pleural effusion in her right lower lobe of her lung that had caused partial lung collapse. They drained 330 ccs (??) If fluid and she could breathe again.

She was still complaining of symptoms of a reaction without the hives and vomiting that used to accompany these attacks when I was younger (the hives and vomiting I saw throughout childhood don't occur so much with her anymore). I talk her into going to her local hospital, and they find an extremely elevated tryptase level (another indicator of SM) and admit her.

I research SM on NCBI and see that of she does in fact have SM that a whole host of precautions should have been taken peri- and post-operation (and MAYBE she shouldn't be taking some of the drugs bc they are known to activate histamines).

She is still doing poorly but is becoming quite resistant to any more treatment and is now discharging against advice, from what I understand (I am no longer with her as I'd been with her for 14 days and I have three special needs kiddos... I had to come home for at least 24 hours to give hubby a break).

Do you have ANY advice for what home precautions she should take?

I'm going to contact Mayo Pathology to see if they still have her large tissue samples to test for mast cells (idk if that'll work after so much time after surgery??) I've been on the phone off and on with Schaff's on call person who ALSO agrees she probably has SM after looking into it).

But what can we do? How much higher is her risk of additional complications if she goes home with this uncontrolled reaction still going on? 

Ugh, I hate this. Any advice appreciated. Going to take a nap and will answer any Qs if I see any when I wake up.

"I'm a 39 year old male.  I'm 6'0'' and I currently weigh approximately 140 lbs.  I have a 20 year history of GI issues.

  
Starting in 2003, I began experiencing abdominal pain in my lower right side.  Sometimes it was dull, other times, I felt like I was being stabbed with a knife.  Between 2003-2009, I went to the ER countless times, each time the ER ruling out appendicitis, sometimes saying they didn't know what was going on, or assuming I pulled a muscle.  It eventually got in the way of school.  I was missing classes daily because I was writhing in bed with stomach pain.  Two times between 2009 and 2011, I was given ""go lightly"" upon leaving the emergency room because I was severely backed up.  
In 2011, I noticed that my stomach was getting worse and that gluten seemed to be a possible culprit.  I went to my doctor and he did a test for a gluten allergy.  It came back positive, but he said that he it could be a false positive and sent me for further testing... an endoscopy.  Upon looking at my small intestines (because my sister has Crohn's disease), they said it looked fine.  However, they said I had the stomach lining of an 80 year old man (I was 28 at the time).  They sent for further blood work and found I was vitamin b12 deficient.  I was diagnosed with Pernicious Anemia and have been doing monthly b-12 injections since.  After almost 2 years of shots, my side pain went away and I largely felt ok for a while.  

  
Around 2005 ish, I started getting nauseous in the morning and would sometimes throw up stomach acid/yellow bile? It would be very infrequent; however, over time it started to increase in frequency.  Once a year became a couple times a year, to several times a year, to once a month, to multiple times a month, to almost near daily by 2020 and 2021 .  It was a slow progression, with it becoming worse around 2019. And even worse after having covid in May 2020.   If I wasn't throwing up bile, it was undigested food or frothy foam.

  
In 2014, I started seeing a GI doctor who initially diagnosed me with IBS.  He was also concerned that my b-12 deficiency went unchecked for too long and wanted to do an endoscopy.  He diagnosed me with acute gastritis with intestinal metaplasia in the fundus of my stomach; no h. pylori infection.  Over the past 9 years, I now have chronic, atrophic gastritis throughout my stomach with intestinal metaplasia in the fundus, noted thinning of the rugal folds of the mucousa, and no h. pylori infection.   
Fast forward to September 2020.  My symptoms include having fleeting moments of feeling like absolute garbage.  Throwing up seemingly almost day for three months. I was throwing bile and mostly undigested food.  I saw a different GI for a second opinion.  He wanted to check me for Gastroparesis and sent me for a GES.  I was getting full very early.  Lettuce was making me extremely bloated as well as small meals.  After 4 hours, I still retained nearly 40 % of my meal in my stomach (bread and scrambled eggs).  I've been taking Motegrity since December 2020.  I also was having a lot of diarrhea and abnormal stools. The doctor ran a ANA screen and I was positive.  He diagnosed me with Idiopathic gastroparesis.  

  
Late summer of 2021, I had a flare up... I was throwing up everyday again.  Could barley hold food or water down. I ended up getting in with Cleveland Clinic and saw a gastroparesis specialist.  Cleveland Clinic measured my GAD levels at >120 IU/mL.  Based off my history and symptoms and tests he ran, he diagnosed me with Autoimmune Gastrointestinal Dysmotility (AGID), and pelvic floor dysfunction after doing a pill capsule endoscopy.  I was prescribed Linzess and ordered to do pelvic floor physical therapy after failing the balloon manometry test. During this flare up, constant, daily nausea also started affecting me.  In addition, after spending hours in the bathroom and on the toilet, I was experiencing episodes of feeling extremely dizzy upon standing up.   It impaired me to the point I would go lay down upstairs at work for hours until I felt well enough to drive home so I could go feel miserable in my bed.  The doctor prescribed me IVIG therapy for my AGID which United Healthcare denied.  The denied his peer to peer appeal as well as his written appeal. I gave my insurance guy everything needed for an external appeal from the State of Illinois.  He called me up to tell me that was denied all the way to the top.  I found out 6 months later that he never sent it in to the state but to United Healthcare's review team who obviously denied me and wasted my fucking time....  During this time my weight dropped from 150-155 lbs down to 130 lbs.  Daily chronic fatigue and napping all day between the months of August 2021 and December 2021 became my normal activity when I was shitting my brains out or throwing up.  My food intake was probably below the threshold of what it takes to survive.  Also during this time, my sleep became very interrupted.  I started missing sleep due to having to be in the bathroom for hours, or just being so ill that I was fatigued and exhausted.  I got sleep when I could.  During these three months, a lot of the sleep I got was on the floor next to the toilet incase I had to throw up or shit my brains out... or try to shit my brains out unsuccessfully. 

  
I found out about a clinical trial at the University of Louisville's Motility Clinic of IVIG for AGID. I contacted them and started seeing 1 of the 2 doctors running the study.  This was in May of 2022.  I was sent for an array of blood tests.  Again, my GAD was measured, this time at >250 IU/mL.  My IA-2 Antibody was measured at <5.4U/mL.  Insulin autoantibody at <.4U/mL  
Doctors have run tests for diabetes on me, but I come back normal.  Cleveland Clinic seemed possibly concerned that I might have LADA aka Diabetes type 1.5.  University of Louisville also did a CTAngiogram on my abdomen.  I was positive for SMA syndrome but with no blockage.  The doctor at University of Louisville was also checking me for SPS, stiff person syndrome, due to a history of tightness and muscle spasms.  My EMG at UofL came back normal in Sep 2022.  Shortly after my trip to Louisville, my weight dropped from 145 lbs back to 130 lbs.  I've been hovering around 140 ever since.   
Last December, I started talking to my doctors about my concern that when I seemed to be feeling terrible, it was usually accompanied by a bad taste in my mouth.  I also told them I seemed to be always clearing my throat.... like something was stuck back there.  They sent me for the ""cookie test""  Fluoro with barium that came back inconclusive. They then sent me for a Fluoro video swallow study that showed mild dysmotility or ""to and fro movement"" of food down my esophagus.  They then sent me for a Fluoro Esophgaram with air contrast that I had high acid in my stomach, as well as ulcers and inflammation in my esophagus.  I wasn't diagnosed with GERD, but it almost sounds like I have it based on the ulcers... I am taking Omeprazole for it.... About 1 1/2 months into a suggested 6 month course of Omeprazole.

  
Doctors have run tests for diabetes on me, but they come back normal.  Cleveland Clinic seemed possibly concerned that I might have LADA aka Diabetes type 1.5.  University of Louisville also did a CTAngiogram on my abdomen.  I was positive for SMA syndrome but with no blockage.  
I've been denied 3 times for IVIG therapy since the end of 2021. I haven't worked for nearly 2 years.  I seem to be getting so far with specialist before things just seem to drop off.... like no more tests ordered, and I don't even hear from the doctor to see how I'm doing.  
Another thing I  am concerned might be playing a role is a positive carrier status for the CFTR mutation for cystic fibrosis, according to 23andme.com.   My longtime gf's brother introduced me to them in 2013 and told me he found out he had a factor 5 blood clotting disorder.  He went to his doctor and they confirmed.  He told his sisters to get checked, they both went to their doctors and both were diagnosed as factor 5.  I've read that carriers for cystic fibrosis, while not having lung issues or the full blown disease, still suffer from a possible range of effects and symptoms that can wreak havoc on the GI tract... particularly with the pancreas and bicarbonate channels and levels.   
That being said, should I start seeing an endocrinologist about the possible LADA?    
Who would I even go see to get a true reading on my GAD levels?  They were measured two times last year, both at >250 IU/mL.  23andme.com also says I'm at risk for Hashimoto's Disease... which my dad's sister has.  I had a blood clot in my right arm in 2005 and they found 2 nodules on my thyroid.  I've had a very fast thyroid all my life. In 2013, I went from 150 lbs to 190 lbs.  By the end of 2014, I was back to 150 lbs.  I lost 40 lbs in 4 months to 5 months. 

  
I recently had my vitamin D and b-12 levels rechecked.  I was vitamin D deficient in December 2022... my level was at 9.  I'm now at 75.  My b-12 is currently on the low end of normal.  It's in the 190's now.  I stopped doing b-12 injection from Feb 2022- Dec 2022 because my b-12 level was over 1800, twice the normal high.  Not sure why it was that high, I was getting my shots monthly as I had done since 2011.  I also seem to have low ferritin levels.   
Should I be seeing Rheumatologist to help diagnose whatever autoimmune issues I seem to be dealing with?  
I used to work full time at my family's business doing autoglass installations and auto upholstery work Monday through Saturday 6 days a week, about 70 hours a week.  
Any suggestions are appreciated.  Feeling so lost and defeated after years of feeling like shit and 2 years of not working.  
I'm not mad at the doctors.  They've been very nice, pleasant and genuinely seem like they care and want to help me.

"So my father was diagnosed with non-epileptic attack disorder a little over four years ago. After months of investigation, they settled on NEAD after attributing it to childhood trauma (my Dad grew up mainly in the care system). He is 62 years old and is a skinny guy.

He has seen specialists outside of the NHS and has even been a part of clinical trials. However, nobody has come close to a way of curing my poor father.

He is having seizures almost every day, nowadays they usually come on after eating a meal or at completely random times. Sometimes he can 'come out' of the seizure but will have to spend the afternoon in bed until the feeling of electricity in his body goes away.  A seizure begins with him looking catatonic and slurring his words, sometimes he can beat this stage especially if my Mum helps him to focus. If this fails he will end up convulsing on the floor and can have to wait up to an hour until he regains complete control of his limbs and may retire to bed. He is always conscious during his seizures.

Now there is something that I don't think he has ever told the professionals. Ever since I have known my father (I am 31) he has had a drinking habit. He rarely gets drunk these days but without fail he drinks at least four strong British ales (averaging around 5% alcohol content) every night. He will drink in the daytime if he can find any excuse such as a family celebration and he often sneaks off from my mother on walks with the dog to the local pub. Now I feel there is a link here as he has had to quit his favourite drink of red wine as it brings on seizures.

I have suggested to him many times to try to quit drinking as they may be the cause of his seizures but he is not interested.

It is also worth noting that he did have epilepsy (could have been a misdiagnosis though) as a child.

So I have two questions:

Do you think my father's drinking is related to his seizures?

Do you consider my father to be an alcoholic?

Thank you so much",1,father diagnosed non epileptic attack disorder little four year ago month investigation settled nead attributing childhood trauma dad grew mainly care system year old skinny guy seen specialist outside nh even part clinical trial however nobody come close way curing poor father seizure almost every day nowadays usually come eating meal completely random time sometimes come seizure spend afternoon bed feeling electricity body go away seizure begin looking catatonic slurring word sometimes beat stage especially mum help focus fails end convulsing floor wait hour regains complete control limb may retire bed always conscious seizure something think ever told professional ever since known father drinking habit rarely get drunk day without fail drink least four strong british ale averaging around alcohol content every night drink daytime find excuse family celebration often sneak mother walk dog local pub feel link quit favourite drink red wine brings seizure suggested many time try quit drinking may cause seizure interested also worth noting epilepsy could misdiagnosis though child two question think father drinking related seizure consider father alcoholic thank much,anger

"Your father needs to see a neurologist and be honest about his drinking. He could be drinking far more than you think. Alcoholics tend to hide their habit from family. His alcohol consumption could be causing the seizures. If they aren't related, they sure as heck aren't helping. **He should not quit drinking unless medically detoxed.** I cannot emphasize how important this is.

Based off what you describe, yes, I would consider your dad to have a drinking problem.

"Hi,
I dont know if this is the right place to ask,but I'll try anyway.
I'll also ask on some other sub forums to get more answers.

I'm a 30 year old male from Germany. I have suffered the last ~16 years from (severe) juvenile arthritis.
Luckily I have my disease under control (with Minocycline) without immunosuppressive drugs. 
I have no signs of inflammation,no morning stiffness and only very little pain.

But in all these years , my joints suffered a lot of damage due to the severity of my disease.

The standard Arthritis drugs didnt really work and had severe sideeffects.

My Rheumatologist wants to replace my (left) Hip,fuse the ankles and get some other surgeries done like hands,knees,feet.
I dont really want to get the Hip replaced due to my young age,possible complications if anything goes wrong and due to short longevity of endoprosthetics.
I have tried to research on my own and asked few doctors for help,but I didnt really get too far.

I know these kind of surgical treatments a pretty new and will become more popular within the next years

Thats why I'm asking the Internet for help.
Maybe there is somewhere a surgeon who specialized on these new surgical treatments or someone knows a clinic where these new treatments are implemented.
The location doesnt really matter. I'm willing to go anywhere in the world,as long someone can help me with my joints and avoid to get my Hip replaced and maybe even avoiding ankle fusion.

I'm looking for things like stemcells,cartilage regeneration,cartilage transplantation,biodegradable implants,orthobiologics.3D printing of joints,cartilage and jointparts and other new methods that could help me.

I would be willing to participate in clinical trials if they are promising.

If I forgot anything please ask.

"There have been experiments, but nothing has really been effective so far. And those experiments are usually in cases with small areas of cartilage damage (not the entire joint as in your case) and usually in other joints (ankle/knee)

Hip replacements are pretty much the biggest success story in orthopaedics. I can imagine that it's scary, and of course there are small risks, but if the osteoarthritis is really bad and limits you in your daily life, I think you will benefit greatly from it.

the biggest problem is in my opinion the longevity of endoprosthetics. 10-15 years isnt much. another problem is,that most big joints are affected.

The standard of care with a positive result from a SLNB is to continue to an ANLD followed by radiation. I was offered to join a clinical trial comparing the standard of care to radiation alone with no more surgery. I accepted the study on the chance of not having to have the surgery and was randomized into the surgery group. Now, I am doing my due diligence to see if I should refuse the surgery and move on to radiation. I am concerned about the high chances of lymphedema given that I am still dealing with significant neuropathy in my hands. I have read the studies that have already been done and I believe that the evidence is compelling that an ANLD will not lower my risk of recurrence by enough to risk the lymphedema. My surgeon and my oncologist were willing to reassure me that an ANLD is not necessary as long as I was part of the study, but cannot go against the standard of care otherwise.

"Age 62 M 5'8, 150 lbs. non smoker no major health issues, good health, physically active, decnt shape. Take Wellbutrin XL 300mg 1x day. No other rx.   CDSH, approx. 4 months. (see below) 

After hitting my head lightly in April, I was diagnosed with bilateral chronic subdural hematoma about a month later. ​ Had no neurological symptoms, just headache, pressure. Neurosurgeon recommended stopping any alcohol and nsaids, got blood work had me follow up in 1 week -ordered a new CT.

New CT read on **June 4,** he diagnosed as bilateral sdh…and having no neuro symptoms agreed to keep watching it and ordered another CT in 7 wks, to follow up.

Meantime headaches and pressure has pretty much gone away - and the only symptom is what seems like pulsatile tinnitus

I just did the 3rd CT on july 30, still basiclaly asymptomatic, in fact thought it would show regression of the hematoma(s).  But the reading showed a  minimal increase in size on right, (abt. 0.1 cm) and no midline shift, not acute…left hema had signif. decreased in size….

He was ok to continue watching/waiting w/ no symptoms, but not really any advice, and called for another scan in 2-3 months.

I talked with my primary doc about research on any non surgical treatment One of them being atorvastatin that some clinical trials had shown helped reduce volume of hematoma.  Another treatment involves Goreisan, an herb based med which has apparently shown positive results in use in Japan, China.

What I'm a little lost about is doing anything I am doing that could be aggravating or preventing the hematoma from decreasing or regressing…. or things i could to do accelerate the reabsorption of blood….

I'm also curious abt. this pulsative sensation in my ear - where i feel blood rushing and pulsation and comes on after any sort of extended mental exertion or stress - and how its related to the CDSH.

I have heard ""ooze"" mentioned as far as CDSH...I guess im not clear what would cause new blood to enlarge the hematoma, or how it naturally breaks down and regresses if any blood is still entering the space...

I very much want to avoid burrhole surgery.  (and there is a new alternative surgery involving meningeal embolization).  Simply am looking to try or do anything possible to enhance a natural healing process.  For now it's basically doing as little as possible.

"Hi and I am so sorry that I did not see this sooner. I have not been here for quite awhile!  I studied everything I could find about Chronic Subdural Hematoma and yes it can result from a light to moderate hit -- best to have the MRI or CT to determine.  I did several. For me, it has subsided to the point of nearly resolving, over the course of about six months. What I found that MAY have made all the difference was a clinical trial using a drug treatment, Atorvastatin (Lipitor) - that's shown positive outcomes for patients with CDSH in several countries. My Primary Doc was willing to prescribe it 1x/nightly for a few months. The subsequent imaging after about 2 months on that regimen, showed substantial reduction in the size/scope of the hematoma and on latest scan it was minimal. I'll do one more MRI this month to check the progress, having continued on this drug course for another couple of months. Now the neurosurgeon had no intention of discussing any non-invasive options for this. The conventional wisdom is that one needs a 'burr hole' surgery where they drain any blood that has collected. I was hell bent on avoiding this. I also found a less invasive new surgical option where the neurosurgeon goes in arterially with a cather and 'cauterizes' the microscopic blood vessel(s) that is effectively supplying the blood and never allowing the hematoma to re-absorb. After that procedure is performed, most patients see the condition resolve. This is called MMA (middle meningeal artery) emoblization. Dr. Jason Knopman at Weill Cornell Medicine in NYC has pioneered it in the US. I'd be happy to find the links if you feel you need to pursue any sort of treatment, but hopefully you don't have this at all: )   Thanks and be well!  -Mike",1,hi sorry see sooner quite awhile studied everything could find chronic subdural hematoma yes result light moderate hit best mri ct determine several subsided point nearly resolving course six month found may made difference clinical trial using drug treatment atorvastatin lipitor shown positive outcome patient cdsh several country primary doc willing prescribe x nightly month subsequent imaging month regimen showed substantial reduction size scope hematoma latest scan minimal one mri month check progress continued drug course another couple month neurosurgeon intention discussing non invasive option conventional wisdom one need burr hole surgery drain blood collected hell bent avoiding also found le invasive new surgical option neurosurgeon go arterially cather cauterizes microscopic blood vessel effectively supplying blood never allowing hematoma absorb procedure performed patient see condition resolve called mma middle meningeal artery emoblization dr jason knopman weill cornell medicine nyc pioneered u happy find link feel need pursue sort treatment hopefully thanks well mike,joy
"I am a 25 year old, white male, in good health. I have been dealing with fluid build up in my retinas for going on 2 years now. I’ve seen 5 different doctors between the Ann Arbor Kellogg Center and the Cleveland Clinic since this began. It started out as a tiny blur in the center of my right eye which then gradually got a bit bigger until the fluid build up plateaued while the right eye was doing its thing; the left eye started to get the same issue with the fluid build up. Both eyes have reached a point of plateau and have stayed relatively the same for about a year or so now. 

The doctors tried to diagnose me with something called x-linked retinoschisis. I did a gene test for that and it came back negative. I’ve done a full panel gene test as well. At the moment the doctors all think  this is due to the high amounts of niacin I was taking every day in my pre workout supplements and energy drinks I would drink at night. I’ve cut those off and haven’t had any in about 4 months.  I’ve been taking 1 drop of Azopt in both eyes, 3 times daily. 

I feel as if I’m in good hands with the doctors I’ve seen but they are to the point where they don’t know what else to do. I’ve even went and had a brain scan done to see if maybe something up there was causing this and that came back normal. They tried all their eye exams and tests they could think of. I’ve had a steroid injection in my left eye when this all beginning and they are now wanting to try that again as a last resort. If they try this again and it doesn’t work I would be looking for a new doctor to see. 

I just need an answer to what my problem is because it’s driving my stress levels through the roof. There is still no official diagnosis. So what do I do next? Just continue to sit around nervous that I’m gonna eventually lose my vision?

"I am reaching out to the reddit community in hopes of finding treatments for my father, 56-year-old healthy male who has suffered **Brain injury secondary to encephalitis and intracranial hemorrhage** to his left temporal lobe, right cerebrum, and right brainstem.  I am hoping someone might be able to help point us to any available clinical trials, approved treatments (or know of any neuro specialists or institutions that we can look into).  Any information you can provide on potential treatments (*i.e. devices than can stimulate the brain, neuro centers or neurologists that may have treated patients with such conditions, etc*), we can look into will be much appreciated


A brief summary of the patient:
His initial hemorrhages were a result of HSV-1 but were small and doctors believed there was a high probability of him waking up from comma and having some minor disabilities.  The hemorrhages substantially increased in size due to blood thinners, which were intended to treat for blood clots that he developed while he was in a comma.
56- year old male with no prior medical history, has been in a comatose state since mid-January, 2017.  He comes in and out of consciousness: responsiveness to pain, frequent spontaneous eye blink, blinks to threat, occasionally opens eyes to sound.  
He is not on a ventilator and is breathing on his own.

Further information / medical records can be provided if needed.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Update: His intracranial pressures are stable.
He came in with small hemorrhages resulting from HSV-1.  Neurologists were confident he would wake up and recovery with potentially minor disabilities if any.  His condition worsened as a result of blood thinners while he was hospitalized.  ICP Catheter was inserted to manage the pressures and was removed after about a week once the pressures stabilized.

"I see now that your question was regarding treatment. 

The treatment of any brain injury is centred towards the secondary insults as it is not possible with our current technology to reverse the original damage. The brain is often and unforgiving organ.  


Now the job of a neurosurgeon and neurointensevist is to prevent secondary injury from high pressure. If there are signs of high pressure the neurosurgeons will then offer a decompression. Sometimes there is also problems with the normal drainage system of the brain causing fluid build up which would require fluid diversion. All of this is easily diagnosed and managed if necessary. All these interventions are focused in preventing people from getting worst and don't fix the original injury. 


Now the question I think your looking for is there any quick intervention to make him better. Answer is unfortunately no. Just have to give him time to see if he is making any progress.  You can't heal a damaged brain tissue.

"Was this spontaneous event or a trauma ?

Anyways I know severe brain injuries are very hard to manage for not just the physicians but the families of the patient as well. 

I am not sure what the exact question is but in general recovery from a brain injury is slow but possible. However the amount of functionality someone can have is different case by case. Sounds like your father is protecting his airway at the present but only has motor response to pain and not verbal. Again I can't tell you what he will be like in the long term but he will never be the same. 

I recommend that you request a family meeting with the medical/surgical team looking after him and ask them all the questions as they know how he has progressed.

"Long post because I want to be detailed. Facts followed by question.

FACTS

My sister was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis yesterday, and I'm trying to understand it more. 

She has been a drinker and smoker the entirety of her adult life. Our parents both died in 2013, and she did not take that well, with severe depression, anger, etc. - a loss from which she never recovered. Heavy drinking and smoking throughout her life increased to up to 2 liters of white/blush wine and 1+ pack of cigarettes a day. 

Over the last several years:
1) neuropathy in her feet (10 years ago)
2) multiple falls with fractures (starting 5 years ago, continuing)
3) a severe infection in her foot resulting in amputation (2 years ago) 
4) her diet has steadily decreased to a point of nonexistence (3 years, progressing to 1 year ago)
5) diarrhea, progressed to vomiting (3 years, progressing to 6 months ago)
6) severe weight loss (beginning 4-3 years ago)

Over the past year, she would call my wife and I, obviously intoxicated. She would repeat stories she told us on a prior phone call. We chalked that up to her just being intoxicated at the last call and forgetting she told us. Other than that, no memory issues really presented themselves. 

Last autumn she was hospitalized for the foot infection. She had delusions of maltreatment/mental torture while there. These delusions lasted beyond her hospitalization for about a week, then they stopped. We assumed DTs/alcohol withdrawal while hospitalized. Her alcohol abuse may not have been disclosed. 

Now she is hospitalized due to hardware from a knee fracture (February) working itself out of her body. 

Prior to hospitalization, she was experiencing blurred vision, hearing issues, and memory loss (thought parents were still alive, and other things).

While hospitalized, her memory loss is worsened, and she is delusional (not about maltreatment) about time/place, etc. Still thinks parents are alive, thinks she's in a hotel, etc. 

She also has pneumonia. And, they had to drain 4 liters of fluid from her body cavity. Urine is apparently very dark/brown. 

QUESTION

First, thanks for reading. I know a long post. With the diagnosis of cirrhosis and the symptimology presented:
1) what stage is this? 
2) if 4, is that effectively/definitely a type of cancer? 
3) life expectancy?
4) recovery?
5) clinical trials?
6) transplant potential (I'm assuming zero based on lifestyle)

REASON

I'm just trying to understand a bit more so that I can be prepared if it is as bad as I think it is.

"Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver, and not cancer. Cirrhosis puts you at risk of developing liver cancer.

> what stage is this? 

Hard to tell. The ""staging"" for cirrhosis is predominantly lab based (Child Pugh Score and Meld Score). I can tell you she is a decompensated cirrhotic since she has ascites and probably encephalopathy. I presume she's jaundiced based on her dark urine, so she would be a Child's Pugh Score of B but would not be surprised if she is C.

> life expectancy? 

Again, would need labs but given her comorbidities, her decompensated cirrhosis and I presume continued alcohol use, prognosis will be poor. Can't give you an estimate without scoring her, but she seems very sick (the mental issues which could be liver disease, the dark urine, the ascites) and if I had to make a really poor guess, life expectancy will be a max of couple years max and that is being generous. She need to stop drinking and get her life together

> recovery? 

Stop drinking. Preferably stop smoking. Take medications she's prescribed. Low salt diet. Start taking herself, and some of her disease may regress but most of it is permanent. This will be the only chance to prolong her life

> clinical trials? 

She wouldn't qualify in her current state (again, the drinking and smoking and probably social issues), and cirrhosis management is very well studied and unlikely there will be anything that will be of use to her.

> transplant potential (I'm assuming zero based on lifestyle) 

Her active alcohol use will be a significant barrier to transplant. Her smoking may have damaged her lungs and heart enough to not be able to endure transplant. Her mental issues will also almost certainly disqualify her if it isn't because of her liver disease. She would need to be evaluated by transplant hepatologists, but in her current state, I am almost certain she will not qualify.

 She will need to make major life changes and get her act together and demonstrate that she will not burn through her transplanted liver. Good rule of thumb is would she, in her current state, make the most of her new liver and take as good of care of it as someone else also on the transplant list? The answer is no.

"First, sorry for the title, I thought it was catchy. 

I am a 30 year old female. I have SLE with discoid manifestations. I take a significant amount of medications including Cellcept, Methotrexate, hydroxycloriquine, viagra, gabapentin and I am a participant in a clinical trial for a biologic. I have a history of really bad headaches, but within the last year my autoimmune disease has started becoming under control and the headaches have disappeared, therefore I quit taking topamax.  I smoke, but don't drink or use any recreational drugs. I have three related questions, but mainly my concern is whether or not an MRI/MRA is absolutely necessary. I am going to preface this with saying I dislike doctor's appointments and I am tired of the plethora of tests. 

Last Tuesday, I went into my GP because a few days prior I heard my heartbeat in my ears (it sounds exactly like an ultrasound of a fetal heartbeat). I have been hearing my heartbeat on a somewhat regular basis for around 3 years, it started when I was on a fairly high dose of steroids. I can only hear my pulse when I am lying down. I went to the doctor because lately the noise has been quite significant and strong. It has sounded like a train was running through my head, all while my head and neck was throbbing and my room appeared to be breathing. It has been so loud and strong, it wakes me. When I wake up, I have a severe pounding headache and am drenched in sweat. My primary care doctor referred me to get an MRI/MRA study, and my first question is whether it is absolutely necessary. By that, I mean will I die if I don't pursue this or is it more of an inconvenience?

My doctor also had asked me if I had any neurological symptoms. While I have a lot of weird and unexplained symptoms, I am unsure of what really constitutes a neurological symptom and what is just kind of wonky. Some of the weird things I experience are: eye problems, neuropathy, strange walking, memory and speech issues, ""lightheadedness"". I can go into depth, but I feel crazy talking about some of these things. This brings me to my second question, what should I tell my doctor about? 

The last question I have is about family history. I only have knowledge about my maternal side. In that, there are neurological disorders. My grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and a brain tumor, my grandfather was diagnosed with Parkinson's. My mother also has a brain tumor (according to their neurologists, their tumors are NOT hereditary). My aunt has a thyroid disorder and my brother has a traumatic brain injury and asthma.

After a successful bowel movement the bloating improves a little.  I recently upped my prednisone to 60 mg as well to help deal with the pain (was afraid I was going to have a blockage).


Well after some googling I have scared myself into thinking I have narcotic bowel syndrome.  Am I just overthinking things, I know opiates can cause both constipation and bloating, but I don't normally get bloating from it, and I had been on a high dose of oxycodone for ~5 months from jan-jun and never had bloating.


Sadly I need the drugs for the pain, but I have kratom as well, I'm tempted to switch over to the kratom because i didn't have near this much problems with it, although it's harder to ingest.  (12 pills instead of 2 at a time...)

"Throwaway for privacy. Thank you for your understanding. It's a long-winded one, but I hope that I've covered all the bases.

My wife (female, 33, 115 lbs, 5'4"", caucasian, USA (Maryland and Colorado)) has passed out at seemingly random intervals over the past 20 months. A lot has happened in that time, and we've had several tests, all inconclusive.

First, the description of a 'typical' episode. My wife feels it coming 5-30 s in advance. If I'm around, she'll call me over. Her face looks a bit pale (often the lips lack color). She will slowly slump over. Her eyes do not close but she becomes non-responsive. Her jaw is locked. She does not shake and doesn't fall out of a chair, but does slump pretty completely. After 10-20 s, she regains consciousness and is really tired. I've taken her pulse immediately afterwards and her heart rate is rapid (radial pulse, so a good deal of blood pressure, but I've never found it right at the beginning of the episode which is inconclusive, to say the least). Almost all episodes have begun sitting down, though once she was standing and had to lie down, and another time it happened first thing in the morning while laying down.

We've been trying to narrow it down to cardiac/circulatory or neurological.


**Cardiac:**

* echo with cardiologist
* 1 month worn ECG with no episodes
* cardiac MRI (for a clinical trial) read and discussed with cardiologist
* findings: nothing. My wife has a generally elevated resting heart rate (80-90 bpm) and generally low BP (100-110 systole, 60-80 diastole). Nothing otherwise out of the ordinary. One cardiologist suggested that the episodes were unlikely to be cardiac because those rhythms rarely have a warning


**Neurological**

* brain MRI
* EEG (like the ECG, no episode during testing)
* findings: nothing


**Background**

* wife has history of migraines
* first episode occurred near the beginning of fertility treatments
* episodes have occurred during pregnancy and since birth
* wife has not had a period in 18 months or so (we think it might be hormone related, migraines were hormone-linked)

"I am a 27yo male, 6'0"", 180lbs. I have had really advanced flat feet my entire life and am an avid volleyball player. Last year I ended up tearing my ACL and have recovered strength-wise to this point. During the rehab, I gradually developed a torn Posterior Tibial Tendon. MRIs, X-rays, and several doctors consults in the Boston area have determined that I will need surgery. The planned idea would be to perform a standard reconstruction surgery with tendon transfer. 

The concerns of the doctors are that I am an extremely rare case and have an aspiration to return to full strength. 

Doctors options are:
-Perform a tendon transfer without the reconstruction, in order to maintain a standard gait and reduced recovery time, with the risk of a failed transfer.
-Perform reconstruction and tendon transfer with FDL

My desire would be to replace the tendon with an allograft - in order to get back to high-impact sports.

My concerns are reconstruction affecting my gait, since my right foot would remain flat. No surgery would be performed on that foot until it is absolutely needed.

I have also read about the possibility of stem cells to help the tendon heal.

I have found that there are no current surgical clinical trials, there's no synthetic alternatives, or other options that I am aware of. (As an aside: I thought it would be interesting to transfer a kangaroo tendon, since their legs are so efficient bio-mechanically). 

I am wondering if anyone out there has some additional insight, knowledge, thoughts, or ideas for this rare and unfortunate scenario I have found myself in?",1,yo male lb really advanced flat foot entire life avid volleyball player last year ended tearing acl recovered strength wise point rehab gradually developed torn posterior tibial tendon mri x ray several doctor consults boston area determined need surgery planned idea would perform standard reconstruction surgery tendon transfer concern doctor extremely rare case aspiration return full strength doctor option perform tendon transfer without reconstruction order maintain standard gait reduced recovery time risk failed transfer perform reconstruction tendon transfer fdl desire would replace tendon allograft order get back high impact sport concern reconstruction affecting gait since right foot would remain flat surgery would performed foot absolutely needed also read possibility stem cell help tendon heal found current surgical clinical trial synthetic alternative option aware aside thought would interesting transfer kangaroo tendon since leg efficient bio mechanically wondering anyone additional insight knowledge thought idea rare unfortunate scenario found,joy
"I don't even know if this is the right place to post this. I have a very close family member, female aged 31, I was actually their maid of honor at their wedding, who I am starting to have serious questions about. She has a history of lying/manipulating but obviously no one expects someone to lie about something so serious. Here is the timeline : 
February 2014 she told me she had cancer- Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, that the doctors were just keeping an eye on it. She was engaged at this point and left her fiance, left her kids with my mom, and started travelling and dating a coworker. Her children still live with my parents. She said she had to have a full hysterectomy to make sure she didn't get pregnant again, but she had it done out of state. 
Summer 2014 she said the doctors had missed something and that it was actually Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia and that she only had 6 months to live. She cut her hair really short, started exercising pretty intensely. Said she didn't want to do treatment because she would rather just travel. 
Early 2015 she was travelling nearby and came to visit for one day. I wasn't able to spend any time with her now fiance because she had him stay in a hotel while she stayed at my house. She had a syringe and some medicine that was in a tupperware container she said was a clinical trial she was apart of. She also walked with a limp- like her leg was really stiff- she said that is where the cancer was concentrated.
Summer 2015: She and her fiance decide to get married. I sobbed the entire time. She was smoking a lot of pot and using cannabis oil, which she claimed was helping her like beat the cancer. She was also juicing, working out a lot, and just trying to be really healthy. She was still smoking and drinking also, but I figured if she had months to live I wasn't going to stop her. 
Early 2016: She was still defying odds at this point for me. She and her husband visited, she had an awful cold which I think was from being so sick. On their way back home (a few states over) they stopped somewhere because she was so sick that she had to go to the hospital. Said the cancer had spread to her kidneys, stomach, colon, and lungs. 
2016: Basically the entire year she would dodge questions if I asked, would say she was thinking about getting treatment, was living in a different state every 2 months but said her doctors were transferring her stuff to new doctors when she moved. She works in mines and as a pipe fitter and has to work to keep insurance. She had a full body mri and cat scan in september and said the leukemia was pre b cell. 
2017. She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in addition to the ALL. She said she was doing chemotherapy in February, then a bone marrow transplant, then more chemotrherapy. I offered to fly up and to be a bone marrow donor because I am registrered and we are the same blood type, but she didn't want anyone there. She had to get some dental work done before they would start the chemotherapy. In November, she had some kind of surgery- I think to remove her ovaries. She is also really hard to get details out of and I have no way of talking to her fiance for information. My sister, who is an ARNP, accused her of faking at this point. She sent a photo of her medication as proof that she wasn't lying-- Ondansettron, clindamyacin, amitriptyline, triamcinolone, and a bunch of supplements. My sister didn't believe her and cut off all contact. In mid 2017 she said they found a 3 inch mass in her breast. 
2018: She had radiation treatment that ended in February. She said they did a full body scan the week after her treatment ended and she was cancer free and that her leukemia is in partial remission, that it is inactive right now and they dont think it will reactivate for at least a few years. She said she had brachterapy for 3 months. 

Is there any way this is all true? If you have any questions, please let me know. I am just in such a state of shock.

"I thought both were more common in women, but it seems to vary between studies. Two meta-analyses I found said women though:

>The demographic profile of the sample shows a prevalence of female. The data support the hypothesis of several case reports and reviews that FD occur mainly in women. However, other studies published in the literature show a clear prevalence in male gender. This illusory disagreement finds an explanation in Freyberger’s words, who asserts that there is a prevalence of men in clinical trials for Munchausen Syndrome, while the women are most common in the classic form of FD with a ratio of 3:1 (Caselli, Poloni, Ielmini Diurni, & Callegari, 2017).

The other paper reported this:

>A total of 33.8% of patients with FD were male. Mean age at presentation was 34.2 years with a median of 32 years and a range of 61 (maximum, 79; minimum, 18). (Yates & Feldman, 2016).

where FD = factitious disorder, used here as a synonym for the classic form of Munchausen's, though technically it's an umbrella term for all types of it.

&#x200B;

**1. Hypothyroidism**

I actually don't remember the exact details of how this went down... Forgive me for my fragmented memory. I'm doing my best to recall. My depression has literally destroyed my memory. I think this dates back to about 2015. My psychiatrist was prescribing me 25 mcg levothyroxine to give me a boost because of my treatment resistant bipolar depression (I rarely suffer from hypomania) as was classically done. She then switched me to 25 mcg liothyronine at my request because I read that it was more commonly used in psychiatry than levothyroxine. It helped me a lot but I worried it was messing with my thyroid hormones. I don't remember what happened after that, but I just remember I stopped taking it, and I switched antipsychotics (from Abilify to Rexulti) and there began my weight gain ""journey"" from there on until today.

Fast forward to a couple of years ago, my thyroid panels showed up abnormal. My TSH was low, yet my T4 and T3 were also low. My general practitioner put me on 50 mcg levothyroxine I believe. My TSH become suppressed, but my T4 and T3 never got within normal range. The dose kept increasing until I got to 100 mcg. I asked to be switched to liothyronine again because I was going through a really rough spot with my depression. I was switched to 50 mcg liothyronine. My pharmacist questioned my doctor, saying that was a very high dose and was unusual for it to be prescribed that high. He called my doctor and he confirmed that he wanted it to be that dose, so I took it at that dose for probably 6-8 months. I realized after a while I was experiencing heart palpitations and other symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Had my thyroid hormones checked, and sure enough, my TSH was extremely suppressed, my T4 was very low, and my T3 was very high. It was at that point my GP referred me to an endocrinologist.

I love my endocrinologist, but he is very old and is very forgetful. But he is such a *very* gentle soul and I love him to pieces. He asks the same question a couple of times during the appointment (maybe he's being thorough?). He asks the same question at each follow up appointment (again, maybe he's being thorough?) But he has me on 150 mcg levothyroxine. For a while, my T4 and T3 were in range (low, but in range), but my TSH was still extremely suppressed.

Here are my results from 2019:

&#x200B;

|Service Date|Report Date|TSH|T4, Free (Direct)|T3, Free|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1/31/2019|2/1/2019|0.099 (low)|0.56 (low)|2.2 (normal)|
|7/17/2019|7/18/2019|<0.006 (LOW)|1.42 (normal)|4.3 (normal)|
|9/24/2019|9/25/2019|0.757 (normal)|0.56 (low)|2.6 (normal)|

I had a telemedicine appointment with him last week so I didn't get to have blood drawn to check my levels, but I did have a rheumatologist appointment recently and she did check some of my thyroid levels.

|Document created|TSH|T4|
|:-|:-|:-|
|3/3/2020|0.007 (LOW)|0.72 (normal, but low according to my endocrinologist)|

He said next time he sees me (in May, hopefully he gets to see me in person) he will do more lab work on me to see if it wasn't a fluke on the blood work. But this has been a trend. Low TSH, low T4, low T3 (with a few exceptions). I could go back further into my records and show the trend, but I don't think that's necessary for the sake of brevity.

He has me on Ozempic which I love. It helps me keep my appetite under control and is keeping my A1c in a nice range. My fasting glucose is in the 80's, which I don't think is too too low. He expressed concern when I told him that, but I told him I liked it there. I don't want this to progress to full-blown diabetes. My dad is ravenously diabetic (completely insulin dependent with a pump), my half-sister on my dad's side is diabetic (type 2) and my paternal grandmother was type 2 diabetic but she reversed it. My paternal grandfather was also diabetic, but he didn't take care of himself.

Anyway, I digress.

**What is causing this weird pattern of thyroid hormones? Is it possible that I have secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism? I guess that would be impossible to find out without doing some more testing, right? (something to do with my hypothalamus and pituitary glands?) What else could be the problem? I have immense trouble losing weight no matter what I do, if that contributes to the clinical picture...**

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**2. NAFLD**

I have had chronically elevated liver enzymes, I guess since 2015 as well. Or at least that's when it was brought to my attention (I was seeing my first neurologist at the time who was a quack). I was on lamotrigine at the time, and she and my psychiatrist both said that was likely the cause, and my psychiatrist said as long as my liver enzymes didn't elevate, it should be fine.

Fast forward to last year, my GP did some routine blood tests on me (including liver enzymes) and lo and behold my liver enzymes were elevated. No surprise there. I've been to a gastroenterologist for it and he didn't seem to want to take me on as a patient. I saw him before for hemorrhoids and he was pretty good to me then, but I don't know what happened to him. He just didn't seem to care. Anyway, I had an ultrasound done on my liver, and it turns out I have NAFLD (not sure what stage...). I saw a clinical trial on Facebook for NAFLD (not sure how they find these things out...) and so I signed up for it. It was actually a legit clinical trial. They scanned my liver and told me I didn't qualify for the trial, but they told me I could come back next year and be scanned again to see if my NAFLD had progressed. I gladly scheduled an appointment. The clinician told me she estimated I was at stage 0 I believe? I was referred to another gastroenterologist, this time one my dad had seen and knew was good. She evaluated me very thoroughly. She ordered several tests, including a bone scan. (!!!!) I turned up with a positive antinuclear antibody factor which was a flag to her, and my bone scan showed increased bone uptake in several of my joints, including my knees, wrists, ankles, and feet. She referred me to a rheumatologist. That took a lot of finagling to get accomplished but I finally got an appointment. I saw her, and she didn't seem too concerned when she saw me. The only thing she noted was that I have joint hyper-mobility (joints pop in and out of sockets, rather painfully I might add—that's something I inherited from my mother). She ordered ***A TON*** of blood work. I was about to pass out before they were done with me. Another flag showed up on the blood work: my CCP antibodies showed up as 26 (weak positive). Of course my liver enzymes were very elevated (ALP = 201, AST = 71, ALT = 196, Alkaline phosphatase = 219). She recommended that I get back in touch with my gastroenterologist and have a liver biopsy. She said it sounds like I might have autoimmune hepatitis, or I might have nothing wrong with me at all.

**What is your take on all of this? Should I have the liver biopsy done? What is involved with a liver biopsy? Is it painful (or do they anesthetize you)?**

"Your labs fit with NAFLD, which is way more common than AIH.  Additionally, I'd expect someone did autoimmune hepatitis labs (anti-SM antibody, anti-LKM antibody) with all that blood they took from you, which would be the first step for determining if you have AIH.  If you already have NAFLD confirmed radiologically, then I'd be a bit skeptical that you suddenly developed AIH, but it's certainly possible, although rare.  

That being said, if you have quite a few risk factors, and a liver biopsy is the gold standard to diagnose these things.  You're on a ton of meds, and drug induced liver injury should also be on the list.  Biopsies are relatively low risk, though, and if it were me, I'd consider getting one given the complexity of your situation.  I wouldn't say you have ""nothing wrong with you at all,"" as your liver enzymes clearly show something - although the most likely answer is that it's NAFLD.",2,lab fit nafld way common aih additionally expect someone autoimmune hepatitis lab anti sm antibody anti lkm antibody blood took would first step determining aih already nafld confirmed radiologically bit skeptical suddenly developed aih certainly possible although rare said quite risk factor liver biopsy gold standard diagnose thing ton med drug induced liver injury also list biopsy relatively low risk though consider getting one given complexity situation say nothing wrong liver enzyme clearly show something although likely answer nafld,fear

"Thank you so much for your response!

You have eased my mind so much regarding my liver. I still am concerned about my thyroid though.

I looked through the blood tests my rheumatologist did (I don't have access currently to the blood tests my gastroenterologist did...). I didn't specifically see anything labeled ""anti-SM"" or ""anti-LKM,"" but I did see just ""SM,"" which was 14, and the normal was <100. Didn't see anything that was plain LKM though.

I scheduled a telemedicine visit with my gastroenterologist to discuss all this on Tues 4/14 via Zoom. I will ask her if she tested for the anti-SM and anti-LKM at that time.

Would you mind if I checked back in with you on here after my appointment with her and what all she says? She may want to do more blood testing (perhaps?) for more specific things. When I get the results in, do you mind again if I check back in with you here with the results?

It's not that I don't trust my doctors, it's just that  I would like a second opinion, especially regarding my thyroid, but your post has eased my mind about my liver concerns.

I am overweight, have pre-diabetes, have cholesterol and triglyceride issues (forgot to mention those), and metabolic syndrome (forgot to mention that too). I'm very sedentary (forgot to mention that too, herp derp...), need to start exercising and eating right... I have lost a substantial amount of weight in a short amount of time (now down 31 lb in a month and some change) due to quite possibly the worst depressive episode I've experienced in my life, which is good in a way I guess, but it's certainly not the healthy way to lose weight.

Anyway, I'm going to stop here before I ramble more. Thanks again! :)",1,thank much response eased mind much regarding liver still concerned thyroid though looked blood test rheumatologist access currently blood test gastroenterologist specifically see anything labeled anti sm anti lkm see sm normal see anything plain lkm though scheduled telemedicine visit gastroenterologist discus tues via zoom ask tested anti sm anti lkm time would mind checked back appointment say may want blood testing perhaps specific thing get result mind check back result trust doctor would like second opinion especially regarding thyroid post eased mind liver concern overweight pre diabetes cholesterol triglyceride issue forgot mention metabolic syndrome forgot mention sedentary forgot mention herp derp need start exercising eating right lost substantial amount weight short amount time lb month change due quite possibly worst depressive episode experienced life good way guess certainly healthy way lose weight anyway going stop ramble thanks,anger
"All that certainly fits with NAFLD, which usually gets way better with weight loss, so it's awesome that you have some insight into the lifestyle factors.

"Not especially. 

Have some blood work to do and a MR-CT of the abdomen to do here shortly. My liver enzymes are still way out of whack and they seem to be getting worse. I was going to just blow it all off and attribute it to hypochondriasis and do nothing, and also because I couldn't afford a $400 MR-CT copay at the time, but my deductible was magically met just in time so FREE HEALTHCARE!!! (Kinda...) 

Anyway, I rescheduled everything and I'm set to do the MR-CT in the next few weeks and to see my gastroenterologist in September.

Meanwhile, I've been seeing a rheumatologist who has been checking in on the positive ANA factor with the elevated CPP (I think?) levels.

If anyone wants to see my blood tests, I can post results from last visit to my rheumatologist to this past visit on 7/7, because I have access to them via the portal.",1,especially blood work mr ct abdomen shortly liver enzyme still way whack seem getting worse going blow attribute hypochondriasis nothing also afford mr ct copay time deductible magically met time free healthcare kinda anyway rescheduled everything set mr ct next week see gastroenterologist september meanwhile seeing rheumatologist checking positive ana factor elevated cpp think level anyone want see blood test post result last visit rheumatologist past visit access via portal,joy
